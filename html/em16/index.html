      <h1>Election Manager 2016</h1>

      <p>Have you ever wondered what if?  What if 2012 had gone differently,
if perhaps Romney (or Obama) had had a bit more money, been a better
candidate, or just been a bit luckier?  What if someone else had run?
What if a third party candidate had just as much money to spend?  Or
maybe even significantly more?  What could you do with a hundred
million dollars?  A billion?  Ten billion?  What if there were four
competitive parties?  How would that change things?  What if there
were no established parties running at all?</p>

<p>With Election Manager 2016 you can answer those questions and
more...  Try running an election on a shoestring or with an unfair
advantage.  Run as a Democrat or Republican, manage the Libertarian or
Green ticket, or go completely independent.  Let your adviser make all
your decisions for you, or micromanage every decision yourself, or
anything in-between.  The choices are all up to you.</p>


<p>For Mac, iPad, and iPhone:</p>

      <h1>About the Game</h1>

      <p>Election Manager 2016 is an abstract strategic election
simulation game where you manage your ticket in an attempt to
get your candidate elected to the office of President of the
United States.  Election Manager comes with a variety of
scenarios, from a recreation of the 2012 election to a four-way
election between independent parties.  In addition, almost any
imaginable two-to-four way election scenario can be designed by
the player.</p>

<p>The Election Manager 2016 engine uses actual historical and
demographic data to produce reasonable election results, taking
into account factors such as partisan lean and voter elasticity.
The player will not only have to consider states but also media
markets, giving the game a strategic dimension due the
inefficient mapping from one to the other.  For instance, to
target New Jersey's 14 electoral votes, the player would have to
spend money on ads in the Philadelphia or New York City
markets &mdash; but significant portions of those markets are
actually in other states.  So is it really worth spending that
money there, or would it be better spent going after other
states instead?</p>

<p>While Election Manager aims to give you complete control of
your strategy, it also comes with tools to help you manage it
&mdash; up to and including an AI campaign manager to which you
can delegate any part (or all) of your strategy, from campaign
stops to ad buys to state offices to polling.  Game features
include:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Completely customizable scenarios</li>

  <li>Scenarios for two to four parties</li>

  <li>Run a Democratic ticket, a Republican ticket, or any number of
  third-party or independent tickets</li>

  <li>Single player or hotseat multiplayer</li>

  <li>Set up campaign and fundraising stops for your candidate</li>

  <li>Plan your ad strategy for every market in the United States</li>

  <li>Use ads to attack your opponent, or boost your campaign with
  positive ads</li>

  <li>Set up campaign offices in battleground states</li>

  <li>Handle everything yourself, delegate everything to your AI
  campaign advisor, or anything in between</li>

  <li>Tools to help you plan your polling or ad campaigns or
  budgeting</li>

  <li>Data and maps and lots of it</li>

</ul>
