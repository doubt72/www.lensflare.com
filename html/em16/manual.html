  <h1><span id="1"></span>Election Manager 2016 Online Manual</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Election Manager 2016 online manual.  This version of the
  manual is current for version 1.0.3 of Election Manager 2016.</p>

  <p>In Election Manager 2016, you are the manager of a U.S. presidential
  ticket, and attempt to get your candidate elected to office.  There are a
  variety of scenarios, including a recreation of the 2012 presidential
  election, but almost any scenario can be simulated including competitive
  third-party or even four-way election scenarios.  The main strategic
  challenge facing the player is that they can't (for the most part) target
  states directly, but instead must influence states indirectly through the
  media markets that span them.</p>

<h2><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="2">2</span> Getting Started</a></h2>
<p>Even without reading the rest of the manual, it's possible to play the
    game (essentially) on autopilot by letting your advisor make all of your
    decisions for you.  You can either do that by selecting "Advisor Plan" for
    all of the options at the start of each week (i.e., for polls,
    advertisements, offices, and itinerary), or by going to the "Advisor"
    button on the "National" tab in the game and accepting the AI advisor's
    suggestions with the buttons on the top of the panel.</p>

    <p>That said, skimming the <a href="#3">Game Concepts</a>
    section below is recommended to get an idea of what's going on; if not
    before playing a game or two to get a feel for things, then at some point
    later.  Even after you play a few games and have mastered the game concepts,
    it's likely you may start the game using the advisor plans as a starting
    point, or perhaps you might let the AI handle certain things for you and
    handle other things yourself.</p>
<h2><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="3">3</span> Game Concepts</a></h2>
<p>There are two basic concepts that affect everything you (and the AI
    player) does: first, all information is incomplete.  Even if you poll every
    state every week with the most expensive polling option, there's a certain
    amount of uncertainly built into the results (and if the polls are older,
    things may be even less accurate as things constantly shift based on the
    actions the various players make).  This uncertainty affects both you and
    the AI, which will make plans based on the information it has (which may be
    different than the information you have, but is no more accurate than
    yours).</p>

    <p>The second thing is that your most important tool (political ads &mdash;
    but also campaign and fundraising stops) don't target states directly, but
    media markets.  So, despite the ultimate goal is to win enough states to
    win, the fulcrum you have to do so doesn't map up with them directly.</p>

    <p>The basic unit of time in the game is the week; each week the players
    each make a plan, and the plan is executed during the following week until
    the election itself arrives, at which point there's nothing to do but sit
    back and watch the results come in.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="3.1">3.1</span> States</a></h3>
<p>States are ultimately the most important concept in the game. States
      are worth electoral votes, and whichever candidate can win enough states
      to get a total of 270 electoral votes will win the electoral college and
      be elected as president.  However (with the exception of State Offices,
      below), states can't be targeted directly.<p>

      <p>Each state contains one or more <a href="#3.2">media markets</a>. However, while some markets are entirely contained by
      one state, many media markets span multiple states; for instance,
      Pennsylvania contains part of the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh markets (as
      well as others). Since ads (as well as fundraising and campaign stops),
      target media markets, this gives the player only an indirect fulcrum for
      influencing states.</p>

      <p>There is one exception, however: state offices.  These represent a
      candidate's ground game (i.e., they help with voter turnout), and cost
      money to maintain (and more money to establish).  They also require time
      to reach full effectiveness, which only make them suitable for long term
      planning; there's no point in setting up a bunch of state offices during
      the last week before the election, since by the time they get established
      and going, the election will already have occurred. Different states
      require different numbers of offices to be completely effective (depending
      on the state's size &mdash; both population and geographic size).  State
      offices increase a candidate's
      <a href="#3.6">enthusiasm</a>
      over time.</p>

      <p>For the purposes of the game, the District of Columbia is considered a
      state, since it has electoral votes like any other state.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="3.2">3.2</span> Markets</a></h3>
<p>Media markets can be thought of as "cities", although they don't
      quite match up with actual cities (markets sometimes contain multiple
      cities) or even metropolitan areas (since collectively they also cover the
      entire country, including rural areas).  Essentially, they're the areas
      covered by television or radio stations, either directly over-the-air, or
      areas that television stations would be carried by cable or satellite
      television providers.  Every media market covers at least one state,
      though many are split across multiple
      <a href="#3.1">states</a>,
      for instance a market like St. Louis would cover part of both Missouri and
      Illinois.</p>

      <p>Ad buys can be purchased for media markets (the game doesn't really
      distinguish between television and radio, an ad buy is just the amount of
      money spent on a market, whatever the details) and will affect voters in a
      market.  Campaign (and fundraising) stops are also in media markets (i.e.,
      in the city a media market is centered in).</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="3.3">3.3</span> Polls</a></h3>
<p>There are two basic kinds of polls: national tracking polls and state
      polls.  National tracking polls are mostly just flavor &mdash; a rough
      state of the overall election.  They can't be commissioned by the player,
      and ultimately the national vote doesn't really matter and only has a
      rough relationship with the actual state of the campaign.  State polls, on
      the other hand, can be purchased by the players and are important for
      planning.  Every week media outlets (i.e., the game) will commission a
      national poll, as well as some state polls (more polls closer to the
      election, more often for larger states or for states that are closer to
      being a toss-up).</p>

      <p>There are three classes of polls, in order of accuracy (and cost):
      internet polls, robocall polls, and comprehensive polls (representing
      polls by better polling firms that call cell phones and use larger sample
      sizes).</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="3.4">3.4</span> Advertisements</a></h3>
<p>There are two kinds of ads: national and market ads. National ads
      target national broadcasts (or in the case of web ads, which are really a
      type of national ad on the internet).  Market ads, of course, target
      individual markets.  Per voter reached, national ads are a little more
      efficient than market ads, however, many of the voters reached are in
      areas the player probably can't win (or doesn't have to worry about), so
      ultimately market ads tend to be more efficient.  However, as more money
      is poured into them advertisements become less efficient for each marginal
      dollar, so it's best to mix types a bit.</p>

      <p>Ads come in two other basic types: positive and negative (i.e.,
      pro-candidate or "attack" anti-candidate ads).  Positive ads increase
      both a candidate's
      <a href="#3.6">enthusiasm and name recognition</a>.
      Negative ads also increase a candidate's enthusiasm (i.e., the enthusiasm
      for the candidate that bought the ad) &mdash; significantly moreso than
      positive ads do &mdash; but they <em>also</em> increase the enthusiasm of
      every candidate that isn't the target, and increase their opponent's name
      recognition as well.  For that reason, negative ads are most effective in
      two-way races when both candidates are already well-known, but
      counter-productive against candidates that aren't well-known, or when
      there are more than two candidates that are polling closely.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="3.5">3.5</span> Candidates</a></h3>
<p>Candidates are the actors in the game.  Candidates have various
      qualities, the first being "candidate quality" itself.  Quality is a
      measure of how good of a candidate the candidate is, i.e., the likelihood
      voters would want to vote for the candidate (assuming they know who they
      are and they've been sufficiently persuaded to make it to the polls).
      Every candidate (both the vice presidential candidate and the top of the
      ticket) has two skills: campaigning skill and fundraising skill, which are
      a measure of how effective they are at the two activities (although the
      vice presidential candidate is half as effective as the headliner at
      either for the same level of skill for the simple reason that they aren't
      the head of the ticket).  These qualities are fixed once the election
      starts.</p>

      <p>During the game, as the campaign manager, you can decide where the
      presidential and vice-presidential candidates make campaign or fundraising
      stops.  You can also control how many days the candidates prepare for
      debates.  However, how the candidates do at their stops or at the debates
      is out of the player's control; the best you can do is send them in the
      right direction and hope for the best.  During each party's convention,
      the candidates will (of course) attend; this is something else you can't
      control.  Beyond that, candidates will also fatigue, requiring the
      occasional rest day (one day of rest is enough for each week of
      campaigning).</p>

      <p>If candidates revisit markets visited too recently (by themselves or
      the other member of the ticket) subsequent stops will be significantly
      less effective, depending on how recently they'd visited.  This effect
      only applies to campaigning and campaigning again or fundraising and
      fundraising again, not doing one then the other; i.e., it actually is a
      reasonable strategy to campaign in a market then return and fundraise
      there immediately afterwards.</p>

      <p>Any time a candidate makes a campaign stop in a market, this will
      increase the voters' enthusiasm and name recognition in that market. This
      is a cumulative sort of thing, i.e., if the ticket doesn't have much name
      recognition to start with, it will be harder to attract media coverage to
      increase it.  Likewise, fundraising is more effective where a candidate is
      both known and already has a stronger base of support (but is otherwise
      proportional to the size of the market).  Fundraising stops don't
      otherwise have any effect besides raising funds for the campaign.</p>

      <p>Candidates will start with a bit more enthusiasm in their home states
      (more for the presidential candidate than the vice-presidential
      candidate).  This will either happen at the beginning of the game or when
      a (vice presidential) candidate is selected at the national convention; if
      the candidate is an incumbent, they will have the vice president available
      to campaign from the beginning of the game, so the bonus is applied to the
      vice president's home state then.</a>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="3.6">3.6</span> Enthusiasm and Name Recognition</a></h3>
<p>There are only two factors that can be affected by the player: voter
      enthusiasm and name recognition.  Voter enthusiasm represents how much
      voters have been persuaded to go out and vote for a candidate, i.e.,
      turnout.  Name recognition represents how well-known a player is; voters
      won't vote for candidates they've never heard of. Relatively high values
      of both of these are necessary to do well at the polls; neither is
      sufficient by itself.</p>

      <p>Both enthusiasm and name recognition can be increased by campaign stops
      and ads (although attack ads will also affect the values for other
      candidates, see
      <a href="#3.4">Advertisements</a>.
      State offices will also slowly affect enthusiasm in a state over time.
      Name recognition will always increase.  However, over time enthusiasm will
      slowly decay.<p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="3.7">3.7</span> Issues</a></h3>
<p>There are fifteen issues in the game.  Each issue has two positions;
      for the most part, the issues are equal, although events during the game
      will increase support for one side or the other, and support for one side
      of an issue or the other varies from state to state.  Issues must be
      chosen for a ticket before the game begins and can't be changed once the
      game starts.</p>

      <p>The following is a list of issues and positions:</p>

      <table class="manual-table">
  <tr>
    <td><em>Issue</em></td>
    <td><em>"Left"</em></td>

      <p>There is one exception to issue symmetry: being pro-reform on campaign
      reform will disadvantage a player's fundraising.  However, the only
      campaign reform issue events on either side that ever fire will increase
      support for the pro-reform side of the issue.  So in games where no
      pro-events fire, being pro-status-quo is a clear advantage, and vice-versa
      in games where it does.</p>

<p>There are various game events that fire during the game that can
      affect the election.  These can increase the support for the particular
      position on an issue in either a single state or nationally; the effect is
      described in the news item that will appear at that time.<p>

      <p>In addition, there are various events that always occur during the game
      (including, of course, the election itself).  The first is the party
      conventions during weeks twelve through nine (depending on how many
      players there are, if only two, then weeks ten and nine).  If the
      candidate is not an incumbent, the party's vice-president will be selected
      and available starting that week (otherwise the vice-presidential
      candidate is available from the start of the game). The party that has a
      convention will get an enthusiasm boost that week, particularly in the
      market with the convention.</p>

      <p>The other major fixed events are the debates. Any candidates that are
      sufficiently popular by week seven will be invited; the debates themselves
      occur weeks five through two (with week four being the vice-presidential
      debate).</p>

      <p>Random events can be disabled from the preferences panel (from the top
      menu or from the startup screen on the Mac, and from the main menu or
      startup screen on the iPad and iPhone).</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="3.9">3.9</span> Partisan Lean and Elasticity</a></h3>
<p>Some states lean towards one party or another, and some states are
      harder to influence than others.  Some states are also easier for
      third-party candidates to influence.  This is based on actual voter
      elasticity (and partisan lean) data; for a bog-standard two-way
      Democratic-versus-Republican contest, with the candidates more or less
      having the actual party positions, the results of an election will be
      similar to historical elections.  If you swap around the positions, things
      will get more unstable, with party loyalty clashing with issue
      preferences.</p>

      <p>Because of this, even vast amounts of money will only go so far; there
      are states that are out of reach no matter how much campaigning or ads a
      candidate buys there (for example, a conservative republican probably
      can't win DC no matter what, or if they can, they'd win every other state
      in a landslide), and even if not completely out of reach, some states are
      easier to defend than others.</p>

        <div class="manual-screenshot-subtitle">
          Setup screen (iPad, Mac is similar)
        </div>
      </div>
<h2><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4">4</span> Setup Screen</a></h2>
<p>This is the first control screen of the game where users can load
    preset scenarios (or create their own).  The iPad and Mac versions of
    this screen are broadly similar, however the iPhone version is
    slightly different.  On the iPad and Mac versions, the main (election)
    panel and candidate panels are all visible at the same time, on the
    iPhone, the user needs to swipe to the left or right to navigate
    between the main election panel and the candidates setup controls.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.1">4.1</span> Election</a></h3>
<p>On the first panel (top on iPad and Mac versions, left-most panel on
      the iPhone version), the game length (12-24 weeks) and number of players
      (2-4) can be set.  A number of pre-set scenarios can also be generated or
      selected; "2012" will set up an election similar to the actual
      historical election, and various other scenarios can be generated.  If
      generated scenarios are randomized, issues and candidate skills and
      quality and name recognition will be randomized to various extents. Names,
      portraits, home states, and convention markets are always randomly chosen
      when a scenario (other than 2012) is generated, however.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.2">4.2</span> Candidates</a></h3>
<p>The bottom panels (on iPad and Mac) or panels to the right (on the
      iPhone) are for setting up the candidates (to see all of the controls on
      this panel on the iPhone may require scrolling down depending on screen
      size).  All of the candidate parameters can be set here, from name,
      appearance, quality parameters, and issues (on the iPad and Mac, you can
      navigate between various sections via buttons, on the iPhone there's a
      navigation control at the top of the panel).  Any number of players can be
      played by humans (as long as at least one player is human); during the
      campaign, the game plays with hotseat multiplayer (the election itself
      does not involve any player decisions except to see the next state).  The
      incumbent player gets their vice-president from the beginning of the game
      and has their national convention last.</p>

      <p>The player's appearance can be changed by clicking the portrait (or
      touching it on iPad or iPhone).  That pops up a dialog that allows you to
      vary the portrait parameters (or randomize the picture with the dice
      button).</p>

      <p>Home state, party, and convention location can also be chosen for an
      enthusiasm boost for the state or convention location during the location.
      You can also pick the party's color; this is the color that shows up in
      graphs and on the map for the party/candidate.  The colors are arbitrary
      and can be changed however the player chooses (say, if the player is
      colorblind and wants more contrast), it has no effect on game play beyond
      displaying data and results.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.2.1">4.2.1</span> Initial Stats</a></h4>
<p>Various initial stats can be set for each candidate (and will affect
        how a candidate performs).  The first is candidate funds, which
        obviously affects how much a candidate can spend on ads and state
        offices.  The next is candidate quality, which affects how likely voters
        are to vote for a candidate (assuming they know about them or have been
        persuaded to turn out, and are close enough to the candidate on the
        issues).  The next is campaigning skill, which is how effective
        candidates are at campaigning.  Next is fundraising skill, which is how
        effective candidates are at fundraising.  The next is initial name
        recognition &mdash; how well-known the candidate is among the
        voters.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.2.2">4.2.2</span> Issues</a></h4>
<p>The issues panel allows the player to select positions for the
        ticket.  These positions are fixed once the election starts.  For more
        information on issues, see the
        <a href="#3.7">Issues</a>
        section of the manual.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.2.3">4.2.3</span> Vice President and Incumbency</a></h4>
<p>Vice presidents have home states (like the presidential candidate),
        which they give an enthusiasm bonus for when they are selected.
        Portraits are modified in the same way as presidential candidates as
        well, by clicking or touching the portrait.  Likewise, vice presidential
        candidates also have campaigning and fundraising skills.</p>

        <p>If the presidential candidate is the incumbent, the vice president is
        available from the beginning of the game.  However, if the candidate is
        not the incumbent, the candidate will show up during the week of the
        party convention.  The vice presidential candidate can then be pre-set
        with the values here, or if "Select VP at National Convention" is
        chosen, the player will get a choice of three randomly generated
        candidates instead.</p>

        </div>
<h2><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5">5</span> Campaign Screen</a></h2>
<p>This is the main screen of the game.  Again, the iPad and Mac versions
    are broadly similar, and the iPhone version is laid out a bit differently;
    this will be covered below.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.1">5.1</span> Before Each Turn</a></h3>
<p>Before each turn, a "Ready, Player!" screen will appear.  On this
      screen the player will have several choices of how to set up their turn.
      For each set of options (i.e., polls, advertisements, offices, and
      itinerary), the player can choose to have nothing set up or let the AI
      adviser set things up for them.  In addition, for ads and polls, the
      player can choose "Same as Last Week" which keep last turn's ad/polling
      plan (i.e., set up exactly the same plan again this week).</p>

      <p>No matter which options are chosen, they only set up an initial state;
      the player can then modify their plans during their turn however they
      like.</p>

      <p>If there are any new news items during this week, those will also show
      up before the player's turn here after plans are initial plans are
      selected.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.2">5.2</span> Status/Top Bar</a></h3>
<p>On the iPad/Mac version of the game, the top bar will show the current
      player and basic stats for them, as well as how many weeks are left in the
      game.  To the right is the "Finish Turn" button, which will end the
      player's turn.  On the iPad version, there is also a "Menu" button to
      access the main in-game menu (i.e., to access preferences, to start new
      games, to see the about screen or load this manual, etc.) &mdash; this
      replaces the standard top menu bar on the Mac version.</p>

      <p>On the iPhone version, the status is split between the top and bottom
      bars; the "Finish Turn" button is on the top, and the in-game menu is
      accessible from the bottom control bar.</p>

      </div>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.3">5.3</span> Map Display</a></h3>
<p>On the iPad/Mac version of the game, the main map is found on the
      bottom left of the screen (on the iPhone version, the map is collapsed
      into the bottom control bar, and available from the left-most tab).  The
      map shows states and markets (assuming they're displayed; see below),
      these can be selected on the map.  On the bottom left is a graph for the
      currently selected state and market, showing the components of that state
      or market.  To the bottom right are controls to navigate on the map; users
      can also navigate by dragging the mouse (Mac) or dragging the screen
      (iPad, iPhone), or can zoom in and out with the scroll wheel (Mac) or by
      pinching (iPad, iPhone).</p>

      <p>Along the top left of the map are controls allowing the player to
      change the display; the choices for the states are "Base Map" (i.e., no
      colors), "Poll Results" (which shows the most recent poll results for
      each state and colors the state with the candidate who is leading, or grey
      if there is no polling for that state), "Poll Age" (which shows how
      recently a state has been polled &mdash; darker is more recent, gray is no
      data), "Office Effectiveness" (which shows the current effect of your
      offices, darker for greater, gray for none), "Offices" (which shows how
      many offices a party has in each state, darker for more, gray for none),
      and "Support" (which shows how much support parties have from state to
      state, again, darker for stronger support, gray for none or no data).</p>

      <p>The next button controls how markets are displayed: "Hide Markets"
      (should be obvious), "Show Markets" (shows markets but doesn't color
      them), "Advertising" (colors markets based on ad spending, darker for
      greater, dark gray for none), "Last Visit" (colors markets based on how
      recently any of the player's candidates have visited them, darker for more
      recent, dark gray for never), and "Last Fundraising" (colors markets
      based on how recently any of the player's candidates have visited them for
      fundraising, again, darker for more recent).</p>

      <p>To the top right is a button that toggles the display of state codes
      and electoral vote values for each state.</p>

      <p>On the iPad and iPhone version of the game, double-tapping will zoom in
      on the map, and triple-tapping will reset/recenter the map.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.4">5.4</span> National Tab</a></h3>
<p>The National (Nation on the iPhone) tab shows top-level information
      (i.e. a tracking graph and basic budget numbers) and can be used to set
      national ad spending (web ads are really just a cheaper form of national
      ads that target the web rather than television stations).</p>

      <p>This (and the other tabs from the following sections) are available in
      the side panel (on the Mac and iPad) or from the bottom control bar (on
      the iPhone).</p>

      <p>For the tracking graph, the "EV" or "%" button can be used to
      toggle between popular vote and electoral vote tracking.  For more
      information on the effect of various advertising options, see the
      <a href="#3.4">Advertisements</a>
      section above.  For the buttons at the bottom of the panel

      <a href="#5.8">Sub-Panels</a> section below.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.5">5.5</span> Candidates Tab</a></h3>
<p>The Candidate (Cand on the iPhone) tab shows current player
      information.  Tickets can be cycled through with the arrow buttons to the
      left and right.  The "Show Platform" or "Show Ticket Info" will toggle
      between a display showing current candidate/ticket information and showing
      the platform positions on each of the issues.  For more information on the
      candidate skills and status, see the
      <a href="#3.5">Candidates</a> section or the
      <a href="#3.6">Enthusiasm and Name Recognition</a>
      section above; for more information on the issues, see the
      <a href="#3.7">Issues</a> section.</p>

      ("<a href="#5.8.6">Itinerary Planner</a>" and
      "<a href="#5.8.10">Campaign History</a>"),
      see the the appropriate
      <a href="#5.8">Sub-Panels</a> section below.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.6">5.6</span> Markets Tab</a></h3>
<p>The Market tab shows information on the currently selected market. The
      market can be selected with the menu bar at the top of the panel (it can
      also be selected by clicking or or touching market circles on the map,
      which will automatically navigate to the market tab as well on the iPad or
      Mac).  Underneath the selector is a list of states and the portion of the
      market that is in each state; these state names can also be selected to
      navigate to the given state.  Other information is also available, such as
      the total size (population) of the market, and the last time your
      candidates visited it.</p>

      <p>From this panel the player can also plan advertising and candidate
      visits (and specify if a visit is intended for campaigning &mdash; i.e.,
      increasing the candidate's exposure &mdash; or for fundraising &mdash;
      i.e., purely to raise money); for more information on advertising options,
      see the
      <a href="#3.4">Advertisements</a>
      section above.  For the other buttons at the bottom of the panel
      ("<a href="#5.8.8">Ad History</a>" and
      "<a href="#5.8.10">Campaign History</a>"),
      see the the appropriate
      <a href="#5.8">Sub-Panels</a> section below.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.7">5.7</span> States Tab</a></h3>
<p>The State tab shows information on the currently selected state. The
      state can be selected with the menu bar at the top of the panel (it can
      also be selected by clicking on or touching the states on the map, which
      will automatically navigate to the state tab as well on the iPad or Mac).
      Underneath the selector is a vote tracking graph as well as the latest
      polling results.  Beneath that is a list of markets found in the state, as
      well as how much of the state falls in that market.  Market names can be
      selected to navigate to the given market.</p>

      <p>At the bottom of the panel the player can commission state polls (see
      the
      <a href="#3.3">Polls</a>
      section above for more information on polling options), and see the
      current status of state campaign offices.  For the other buttons at the
      bottom of the panel
      ("<a href="#5.8.7">Manage Offices</a>" and
      "<a href="#5.8.9">Poll History</a>"),
      see the the appropriate
      <a href="#5.8">Sub-Panels</a>
      section below.  The Electoral Vote value of the state is displayed in the
      bottom left.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.8">5.8</span> Sub-Panels</a></h3>
<p>The following sub-panels are also available during the game:</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.8.1">5.8.1</span> Ad Planner</a></h4>
<p>The ad planner panel can be used to plan or view large numbers of
        market ads at the same time based on the state filter/options chosen at
        the top of the panel.  The first selector is used to filter on a state
        you'd like to target, and the next two selectors control the type of ad
        that can be applied to all the markets in the filtered state with the
        "Apply to Markets" button.  If no state is selected (i.e., all states
        are selected), the ad type/level can be applied to every market in the
        country at once.</p>

        <p>Markets can be selected by clicking or touching the market names on
        this screen; the map will then zoom to that market (though you'll have
        to change tabs to see that on the iPhone).</p>

        <p>The ad planner panel is available from the
        <a href="#5.4">National Tab</a>.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.8.2">5.8.2</span> Poll Planner</a></h4>
<p>The poll planner panel can be used to plan or view your polling
        strategy based on the state filter/options chosen at the top of the
        panel.  The first selector is used to filter on a states you'd like to
        target (based on the various options available), and the next selector
        controls the type of poll that can be commissioned for those states with
        the "Commission Polls" button.  If no filter is selected (i.e., all
        states are selected), polls can be commissioned (or canceled) for every
        state in the country at once.</p>

        <p>States can be selected by clicking or touching the state names on
        this screen; the map will then zoom to that state (though you'll have to
        change tabs to see that on the iPhone).</p>

        <p>The poll planner panel is available from the
        <a href="#5.4">National Tab</a>.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.8.3">5.8.3</span> Advisor</a></h4>
<p>The advisor panel shows what your AI advisor suggests is a
        reasonable plan, as well as whether your current plans match the AI
        advisor's plans.  If the current plan for the upcoming week differs from
        the AI's suggestions, you can apply the AI suggestions with the buttons
        at the top of the panel.  The various sections of the plan (i.e., polls,
        advertisements, state offices, and itinerary) can be expanded or
        collapsed with the buttons at the top of each section.</p>

        <p>Once expanded, you can get an idea of where they states and markets
        listed here are by clicking (or touching) their names on this screen;
        once you do that, they'll be selected on the map (though you'll have to
        change tabs to see the map on the phone). You can also reject (or
        accept) specific parts of the advisor's plan with the buttons on the
        right side of the panel.</p>

        <p>The advisor panel is available from the
        <a href="#5.4">National Tab</a>.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.8.4">5.8.4</span> Budget Summary</a></h4>
<p>The budget summary panel shows the current state of the player's
        budget, as well as how much funds have been raised during the last week
        and also how much the current campaign plan will spend on various
        different activities during the next week.</p>

        <p>The budget summary panel is available from the
        <a href="#5.4">National Tab</a>.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.8.5">5.8.5</span> Top Stories</a></h4>
<p>The top stories panel displays the news stories that have occurred
        over the course of the election; any of the news stories can be
        re-displayed by selecting the story headline.</p>

        <p>The top stories panel is available from the
        <a href="#5.4">National Tab</a>, as well as the
        <a href="#6.6">Election History Tab</a> tab.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.8.6">5.8.6</span> Itinerary Planner</a></h4>
<p>The itinerary planner panel allows the player to plan the campaign
        and fundraising stops for the ticket's presidential candidate and
        vice-presidential candidate (if the vice president has been chosen and
        is available yet).  For each day of the week, the player can visit a
        market or rest; if the candidate chooses to visit a market, it can be
        set up as a campaign stop or a fundraising stop with fundraising
        checkbox (for more information on the difference between fundraising and
        campaign stops, see the section on
        <a href="#3.5">Candidates</a>
        above). In addition to the market visits, during certain weeks other
        special options will be available (i.e., debate preparation) or certain
        days will be blocked off for special events (i.e., debates or party
        conventions).</p>

        <p>The itinerary planner panel is available from the
        <a href="#5.5">Candidates Tab</a> and the
        <a href="#5.4">National Tab</a>.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.8.7">5.8.7</span> Manage Offices</a></h4>
<p>The manage offices panel allows the player to manage the state
        campaign offices for each state.  Offices can be opened (or if the
        ticket is short of cash, closed).  Note that offices take time to get
        established (several weeks to reach peak effectiveness), and cost more
        to set up than maintain.  The information here allows you to see how
        effective the offices will be, and what the other players are doing as
        well.</p>

        <p>The manage offices panel is available from the
        <a href="#5.7">States Tab</a>.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.8.8">5.8.8</span> Ad History</a></h4>
<p>The ad history panel displays all the advertisements that have been
        run during the campaign so far or are currently being planned by the
        current player for the current week.  The ads can be filtered both by
        market (or can be filtered to show national ads, or all ads on the Mac)
        and by ticket (or all tickets).  For each ad displayed, both the party
        that bought the ad and the target of the ad is shown both by color and
        party abbreviation.</p>

        <p>The ad history panel is available from the
        <a href="#5.4">National Tab</a> or the
        <a href="#5.6">Markets Tab</a>, as well as the
        <a href="#6.6">Election History Tab</a> tab.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.8.9">5.8.9</span> Poll History</a></h4>
<p>The poll history panel displays all of the polls that have been run
        so far during the election, as well as polls that are being planned by
        the current player for the current week.  Polls can be filtered by
        state, or national polls can be displayed, or all polls on the Mac. For
        each ad displayed, the type of ad is shown after the state ("I" for
        internet, "R" for robocall, or "E" for exhaustive; see the
        <a href="#3.3">Polls</a>
        section for more information on polling types), as well as the poll
        results (by color and party abbreviation), assuming the poll has been
        run.</p>

        <p>The poll history panel is available from the
        <a href="#5.4">National Tab</a> or the
        <a href="#5.7">States Tab</a>, as well as the
        <a href="#6.6">Election History Tab</a> or
        <a href="#6.4">Election States Tab</a> tabs.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.8.10">5.8.10</span> Campaign History</a></h4>
<p>The campaign history panel allows the player to see all of the
        campaign activities of each of the candidates (i.e., what each of the
        candidates have done each day of the campaign so far, and where they've
        done it).  The party ticket can be filtered at the top of the panel (or
        all parties can be shown at once); note that if it's still the first
        week of the campaign, no activities will have yet taken place so the
        panel will be empty.</p>

        <p>The campaign history panel is available from the
        <a href="#5.5">Candidates Tab</a> or the
        <a href="#5.6">Markets Tab</a>, as well as the
        <a href="#6.6">Election History Tab</a> or
        <a href="#6.5">Election Candidates Tab</a> tabs.</p>

<h2><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="6">6</span> Election Screen</a></h2>
<p>Once the campaign finishes and the election begins, the campaign panels
    are replaced by the election panels to show the election results.  At this
    point, there are no player turns as there is no longer anything to control
    (beyond showing the next state or looking through the results and other
    history, anyway).</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="6.1">6.1</span> Status/Top Bar</a></h3>
<p>The top bar will show the latest election information, and allows the
      player(s) to display the results from the next state when the "Begin" or
      "Next State" button is selected.  As with the main campaign screen, a
      "Menu" button is available on the iPad version to access the main menu,
      and the iPhone version again splits status on the top and bottom (and has
      a "Menu" tab at the right end of the bottom control bar).</p>

<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="6.2">6.2</span> Map Display</a></h3>
<p>On the iPad and Mac, the map is displayed at the bottom left; on the
      iPad the map is accessible from the left-most tab of the bottom control
      bar.  This panel shows which states have been called for which candidates.
      Any of the states can be selected, and at the bottom left (iPad/Mac) or
      top left (iPhone) of the map, a button will cycle through showing
      electoral votes, state abbreviations, or nothing at all.  There is also a
      navigation panel at the bottom right; the map can also be navigated by
      dragging it, or zoomed in and out with the scrollbar (Mac) or by pinching
      it (iPad, iPhone).</p>

      <p>There is one significant difference between the iPad/Mac version of the
      game and the iPhone version: on the iPhone, since it's not possible to
      display both the map and the election tab at the same time (see next
      section immediately below), there's a small display panel at the bottom
      left of the map display that shows pie graphs of the current electoral
      vote totals and the most recent state vote results.</p>

      <p>On the iPad and iPhone version of the game, double-tapping will zoom in
      on the map, and triple-tapping will reset/recenter the map.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="6.3">6.3</span> Election Tab</a></h3>
<p>The election tab shows the current overall state of the election; it
      displays national vote (both electoral votes on top and popular vote
      below), and the voter results from the most recent state called. At the
      bottom of the tab is the historical graph from the tracking polls.  The "%"
      or "EV" button will toggle between national popular vote and electoral
      votes.</p>

      <p>This and the following tabs are available from the panel on the right
      side of the screen on the iPad and Mac; on the iPhone, these tabs are
      combined with the map and menu tabs in the bottom control bar.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="6.4">6.4</span> States Tab</a></h3>
<p>The states tab shows voting results for a given state (assuming the
      state has been called, otherwise the information will still be blank). It
      also shows electoral votes for the state between the state voting results
      pie graph and the winning candidate's portrait.  At the bottom of the
      screen is the number of offices in the state, as well as the tracking
      graph for the state.  Finally, states can be selected with the selection
      button at the top of the panel (or by selecting states on the map).</p>

      <p>At the very bottom of the panel is a
      "<a href="#5.8.9">Poll History</a>"
      button, see the the appropriate
      <a href="#5.8">Sub-Panels</a> section above.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="6.5">6.5</span> Candidates Tab</a></h3>
<p>The information on the candidate tab (cand tab on the iPhone) here is
      identical to the information on the
      <a href="#5.5">Candidates Tab</a>
      (minus the itinerary planner panel) during the campaign.  See that section
      for more information.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="6.6">6.6</span> History Tab</a></h3>
<p>The history tab (or hist tab on the iPhone) shows the results from
      each state (as well as overall national results) in tabular form.</p>

      <p>In addition, the following buttons are available at the bottom of the
      panel:
      "<a href="#5.8.5">Top Stories</a>",
      "<a href="#5.8.10">Campaign History</a>",
      "<a href="#5.8.8">Ad History</a>", and
      "<a href="#5.8.9">Poll History</a>".</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="6.7">6.7</span> Sub-Panels</a></h3>
<p>All of the panels in the election results screen are the same as those
      available during the game, see the
      <a href="#5.8">Sub-Panels</a>
      section above for reference.</p>
<h2><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="7">7</span> End Game Screen</a></h2>
<p>Once the game finishes, a screen will pop up and display the winner (if
    there is one) and some graphs of how the election went, including electoral
    votes, national popular vote, states won, and each candidate's final budget
    (the money raised during the campaign is in a darker color to the
    right).</p>

    <p>At the bottom of the panel are two options: you can either return to the
    map/game (if you'd like to dig farther into the results and other
    information) or immediately start a new game.</p>
<h2><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="8">8</span> Notes</a></h2>
<p>I've had an election game percolating in the back of my head for quite a
    while now; I actually wrote a much simpler earlier version of this game many
    years ago (in [incr TCL] of all things &mdash; there's an obscure language
    for you).  The key concept in this game, though, is something that I only
    considered more recently &mdash; the concept of de-coupling states from
    media markets.  It's obviously one of the key concepts in the the game, and
    the aspect that gives the game a fair amount of its strategic depth.  I
    suppose the fact that this game exists at all is due to the fact that I
    needed to get it out of my system &mdash; it's certainly not a whole lot
    like my previous game, and probably won't be much like any other games I
    create down the road.</p>

    <p>Clearly there are a lot of things that have influenced this game,
    including many years of reading sites such as Nate Silver's 538 Blog
    (<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/">now an independent site</a>
    &mdash; I don't follow it as much as I used to, though), Sam Wang at the
    <a href="http://election.princeton.edu/">Princeton Election Consortium</a>,
    or <a href="http://electoral-vote.com/">electoral-vote.com</a>
    (which was my introduction to polling aggregation sites ten years ago or so.
    Another bit of trivia &mdash; the creator of that site, Andrew Tannanbaum,
    is better known for some pretty good computer science textbooks &mdash;
    including one of mine in college twenty years ago). And too many other sites
    to mention or even remember.  None of these really had any direct effect on
    the game per se; they've influenced me over the years as an election
    observer in general but I've been interested in presidential elections for a
    lot longer than any of those sites &mdash; or even the web &mdash; has
    existed (my previous game predates those sites &mdash; possibly even
    electoral-vote.com &mdash; and I've been playing election games even longer
    than that. My dad even wrote a simple paper-based game when I was still a
    kid &mdash; it had squares with red on one side and blue on the other, back
    when red made more sense for Democrats and blue for Republicans for more
    people than just me).</p>

    <p>So, a lot of things that went into the game probably seem pretty obvious:
    i.e., partisan leanings for states and so forth.  By necessity, pretty much
    every election game has something to model that.  Voter elasticity is a bit
    more obscure concept, but not difficult to understand: that is, some states
    contain more (actual) independent voters than others and are easier to
    influence.  And the dichotomy between media markets and states, as I touched
    on above. Astute observers, however, will notice that I made one major
    simplification from how presidential elections actually work (or at least
    have recently): I turned both Maine and Nebraska into "winner-take-all"
    states.  I did this because (1) the game is just simpler to code and display
    that way (mostly in terms of interface, but also in terms of the engine) and
    (2) those divisions seldom make any actual difference to election results.
    By which I mean it's been rare that those states actually split their vote
    (it didn't happen in 2012 and it's probably unlikely in 2016, though we'll
    see), and when and if they do, it seems unlikely that it would happen in a
    close election in the first place.  That said, I may patch that into the
    game in a future version; we'll see.

    <p>One of the things that was important to me is not that the game is
    "accurate" per se, but that the results are plausible without being
    deterministic.  And that results can be influenced by the player without
    resulting in ridiculously unbalanced results.  I hope I've achieved that.
    If I have, I've done it with a small amount of randomness and just through
    the uncertainty inherent in the noise that not-completely-accurate polls
    give you.  So the election results will always be a bit &mdash; but not
    excessively &mdash; surprising.  I also think that an election game should
    not really have an editorial stance.  In that I mean that I wanted the
    results from the 2012 scenario to come out approximately like the actual
    election did (I mean, that's history), but if you want to level the playing
    field (or give the edge to Romney), feel free.  The game won't judge,
    simulate whatever scenarios interest you.  Personally, I most enjoy playing
    third-party candidates and I suspect many players will, too.</p>

    <p>I also fully intend to add a 2016 scenario when that election comes
    around, and model it to return approximately the results the actual election
    has.</p>

    <p>One of the really enjoyable things for me was working on the game map (or
    maps &mdash; the detail actually scales depending on how far you're zoomed
    in).  I used to work (professionally) doing mapping/GIS programming, and it
    had been a while since I'd done that in my day job.  I really did miss it a
    bit and tweaking the basemaps was actually a lot of fun.  I've actually
    open-sourced the RGeo/Geos code I used to get the various simplified maps
    (for various zooms) on my
    <a href="https://github.com/doubt72/geo-scripts/tree/master/election-map">github account here</a>,
    so feel free to take a look if your interests happen to run along those
    lines.<p>

    <p>So, as a political junkie (and not just American politics, I keep up on a
    fair amount of international politics as well) and having had a life-long
    love of maps, really, how could I resist writing this game?</p>

    <p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy playing it, too.</p>

    <p>&mdash; Doug</p>

    <p>If you've gotten this far, a hint: in the setup screen, when you edit the
    candidate portraits, try setting the candidate's hair color to blond, then
    make them bald with no facial hair.  Then cycle through the head shapes.</p>

    <p>If any of the active candidates have one of the, ah, special portraits
    and random events are enabled...  Interesting things will happen.</p>
