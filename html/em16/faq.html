  <h1>Election Manager 2016 Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <p>This FAQ covers things about Election Manager 2016 that don't
  involve gameplay; for gameplay questions, please refer to the
  <a href="manual.html">online manual</a>.  Feel free to
  <a href="../support.html">contact us</a> if you have other questions
  not covered here.</p>

  <h1>Supported Platforms</h1>

  <p><em>What platforms are supported?</em></p>

  <p>The game is available for Mac, iPad, and iPhone.</p>

  <p><em>What operating system versions are supported?</em></p>

  <p>Macs that can run OSX 10.7 Lion or later; iPads and iPhones that
  can run iOS 7 or later (i.e., the iPad 2 or later -- including all
  versions of the iPad Mini -- the iPhone 4 or later, and iPod Touch
  5th Generation).</p>

  <p><em>Can I play the iPad version on my iPhone and vice-versa?</em></p>

  <p>The iOS version of Election Manager 2016 is universal, so can be
  played on either type of device with one purchase.</p>

  <p><em>Is there any difference between the Mac and iPad (and iPhone)
  versions of Election Manager 2016?</em></p>

  <p>The only real difference between the iPad, iPhone and Mac
  versions of Election Manager 2016 is the interface; the Mac version
  has a full mouse-based interface and the iPad has an interface
  optimized for touch (larger buttons, some slight layout differences,
  touch-and-hold for tooltips, etc.)  The layout will be basically the
  same for the iPad and Mac versions, with some relatively minor
  differences.  More extreme interface changes are required to allow
  the game to fit on the phone, however, but the underlying game
  engine and (for the most part) the high-level structure of the
  interface is the same. Our intention is to keep all platforms as
  similar as possible; any features added to one will be added to the
  others.</p>

  <p><em>Will Election Manager 2016 be available on any other
  platforms?</em></p>

  <p>No, there are no plans for any other platforms at this time.</p>

  <h1>Other Questions</h1>

  <p><em>Does Election Manager 2016 have a multiplayer option?</em></p>

  <p>Yes, hotseat multiplayer is available.</p>

  <p><em>Why doesn't Election Manager 2016 have a 2016
  scenario?</em></p>

  <p>Because the parties haven't chosen their candidates yet &mdash;
  once the 2016 party conventions have taken place and the candidates
  have been chosen, we'll release an update (along with a few "what
  if?"  scenarios).  We'll also update the scenario after the election
  takes place to more closely match the final election results.</p>

  <p><em>Are there any plans to add primaries or to expand the
  debates?</em></p>

  <p>Not at this time, no.</p>
