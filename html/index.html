      <h1><a href="elexi/index.html">Elexi</a></h1>

      <p>Spelling words.  Scoring points.  A board full of tiles with letters on them.
Seems pretty simple, right?  But for every word spelled, there's a cost.  A
choice. A letter that has to be thrown away.  And the choices get more and more
difficult until the letters run out and there are no more choices
left.</p>

<ul>

  <li>Simple rules, easy to learn, but challenging strategic depth</li>

  <li>No timer or time limits &mdash; take your time, figure out your plan.  Or
  just take the first word that catches your eye, we won't judge</li>

  <li>Three game modes &mdash; play single-board elimination mode, level up with
  endurance mode, or play in endless mode just for the fun of it</li>

  <li>Two board sizes &mdash; full boards for more options and greater
  challenges, or play smaller express game boards for a quick fix</li>

  <li>Multiple tile shapes, styles, and color schemes (including a high contrast
  color scheme for colorblind players)</li>

  <li>Multiple languages supported: play with English, Spanish, German, French,
  Portuguese, or Italian word lists with corresponding character sets and letter
  scores</li>

</ul>

      <h1><a href="em16/index.html">Election Manager 2016</a></h1>

      <p>Have you ever wondered what if?  What if 2016 had gone differently, if
perhaps your candidate had had a bit more money, been a better candidate, or
just been a bit luckier?  What if someone else had run? What if a third party
candidate had just as much money to spend?  Or maybe even significantly more?
What could you do with a hundred million dollars?  A billion?  Ten billion?
What if there were four competitive parties?  How would that change things?
What if there were no established parties running at all?</p>

<p>With Election Manager 2016 you can answer those questions and
more...  Try running an election on a shoestring or with an unfair
advantage.  Run as a Democrat or Republican, manage the Libertarian or
Green ticket, or go completely independent.  Let your adviser make all
your decisions for you, or micromanage every decision yourself, or
anything in-between.  The choices are all up to you.</p>


<p>For Mac, iPad, and iPhone:</p>

      <h1><a href="tsc/index.html">Tactical Space Command</a></h1>

      <p>Organize ships into task forces.  Give your ships and task forces
orders.  Promote and assign officers to command your ships, stations
and task forces.  Allocate production. Customize your research focus.
Take that rock or die trying. Smash any planetary defenses that get in
your way.  Bring death and bitter defeat to all that oppose you.</p>

<p>(Tactical Space Command is only an abstract tactical space combat
simulation.  No lifeforms were harmed in the making of this game; all
civilian and military casualties are merely simulated.  Past
performance does not guarantee total victory, offer void in partial
vacuum.  Do not break glass, there is no emergency.)</p>
