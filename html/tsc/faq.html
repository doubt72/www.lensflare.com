  <h1>Tactical Space Command Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <p>This FAQ covers things about Tactical Space Command that don't
  involve gameplay; for gameplay questions, please refer to the
  <a href="manual.html">online manual</a>.  Feel free to
  <a href="support.html">contact us</a> if you have other questions not
  covered here.</p>

<div class="section">
  <h1>Supported Platforms</h1>

  <p><em>What operating system versions are supported?</em></p>

  <p>Macs that can run OSX 10.6 Snow Leopard or later; iPads that can
  run iOS 6 or later. Yes, this means we don't support the iPad 1,
  sorry. Unfortunately the iPad 1 isn't really powerful enough to
  support the game very well.</p>

  <p><em>Is there any difference between the Mac and iPad versions of
  Tactical Space Command?</em></p>

  <p>The only real difference between the iPad and Mac versions of TSC
  is the interface; the Mac version has a full mouse-based interface
  and the iPad has an interface optimized for touch (larger buttons,
  some slight layout differences, touch-and-hold for tooltips, etc.)
  The underlying game engine is the same, the scenarios available in
  each version of the game are also the same. Our intention is to keep
  both versions as similar as possible; any features added to one will
  be added to the other.</p>

  <p><em>Will Tactical Space Command be available on any other
  platforms?</em></p>

  <p>Probably not. Perhaps if there's a TSC2 someday.</p>

  <h1>Other Questions</h1>

  <p><em>Does Tactical Space Command have a multiplayer
  option?</em></p>

  <p>No, TSC was designed as a single-player game from the very
  beginning and we have no plans to add any multiplayer support.</p>
