  <h1><span id="1"></span>Tactical Space Command Online Manual</h1>
<p>Welcome to the TSC online manual.  This version of the manual is current
  for version 1.2.2 of Tactical Space Command.</p>

  <p>In Tactical Space Command, you are a commander of a fleet of spacecraft.
  Though some scenarios have different victory conditions, for the most part,
  victory comes from capturing all enemy planets and asteroids and defeat from
  losing all of yours.  You have various types of ships that have different
  strengths and weaknesses (and hence different natural roles), and stations
  which can defend your planets or repair your ships (if they have a spacedock).
  You have officers you can promote and assign to ships or task forces.   You
  have cargo ships that automatically carry metal from your asteroids to your
  planets that you need to protect in order to keep your economy running at peak
  efficiency (allowing you to build more ships and ultimately defeat your
  opponents).<p>

<h2><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="2">2</span> Getting Started</a></h2>
<p>A good place to start is by playing through the tutorial; when you start
    the game for the first time, it will automatically start.  If you've already
    quit out of it, you can restart it at any time: go to the tactical display,
    choose the main menu at the top left, then select New Game (and select 'Ok'
    to continue) then select Restart Tutorial.  Once you've made it through the
    tutorial, the rest of the manual will probably be a bit easier to
    digest.</p>

    <p>In addition, there are some video tutorials
    <a href="index.html#Tutorials">available here</a>.</p>

    <p>Also, the first scenario ('A Trivial Matter' &mdash; the same scenario used in
    the tutorials) is mainly meant to be an easy scenario for beginning players.
    It's a good place to start for getting oriented on game mechanics and
    strategies and such, since the complexity is low.  The AI is also a bit
    constrained and predictable in that scenario, so it's unlikely that it will
    do anything too surprising while you get the hang of things.  It's a good
    scenario to play a time or two before you feel like you're ready to move on
    to the more complicated and challenging scenarios.</p>

<h2><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="3">3</span> Game Controls</a></h2>
<p>Game controls for the most part are pretty simple: press a button,
    something happens.  On the other hand, tooltips are a bit more complicated:
    in the Mac version, tooltips are triggered by hovering over buttons and such
    exactly as you'd normally expect.  On the iPad version of the game, however,
    tooltips are triggered by holding a button for a short period of time (this
    also works for a few things that aren't buttons, such as ship class icons
    and officer skills on the Ships and Officers Displays).  That's perhaps the
    single most important thing to know when trying to navigate the game.</p>

    <p>Beyond that, there's not much else to know (in terms of how to trigger
    controls, at least) for most of the interface with the exception of the
    Tactical Display (which is a bit more complicated; for that, see
    <a href="#4.1.1">Navigating the Map</a>,
    <a href="#4.1.2">Giving Orders</a>, and
    <a href="#4.1.4">Events</a>
    in that section).</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="3.1">3.1</span> Loading, Saving, and the Main Menu</a></h3>
<p>The Main Menu is where you can start a new game, load a game, or save
      the current game.  It can be reached by selecting the menu button in the
      top left corner of the <a href="#4.1">Tactical Display</a>.
      There's also a 'Score' screen that keeps track of some game stats (there
      isn't really a score as such), and an 'About' screen, but those aren't
      really necessary for playing the game.  Also possibly useful is the help
      browser in the bottom right corner of the main menu screen &mdash; from there
      you can read any of the context help for any of the displays or cycle
      through the game start tips if you like.</p>

      <p>Whenever you start the game up and you don't have a current autosave
      (i.e., you've already won or lost your previous game, say), you'll go
      directly to the new game screen instead of the tactical display.  In
      general, you don't really need to worry about loading or saving the game
      unless you want to; say if you want to try something and go back to the
      previous point in the game if it doesn't work out, or you just don't feel
      like finishing your current game until later and want to start a new one
      instead.  The game will autosave anytime you quit (<em>Mac</em>) or any time
      you background the application (<em>iPad</em> &mdash; this is triggered when you
      hit the home button to go to the home screen or if you turn off the
      display with the wake/sleep button, or if the device backgrounds the
      application for any reason).</p>

      <p>The <a href="#6">Scenario Editor</a> is also available
      from the new game screen.</p>
<h2><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4">4</span> Game Displays</a></h2>
<p>The game is primarily organized by screen or display; see the following
    sections for a discussion of the purpose of each.</p>

    <div class="manual-screenshot-right">
    <a href="../assets/tsc/manual/display-annotated.png"><img src="../assets/tsc/manual/display-annotated.png" alt="Tactical Display" class="ss-link" style="width: 400; height: 300;" /></a>
      <div class="manual-screenshot-subtitle">
        Tactical Display (iPad version, Mac version is similar)
      </div>
    </div>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.1">4.1</span> Tactical Display</a></h3>
<p>The tactical display is the heart of the game, and you'll spend most
      of your time here.  Most (but not quite all) things can be controlled from
      this screen.  On this screen you can select planets, asteroids, ships and
      stations and (assuming you control the selected items) give them orders or
      objectives.  The various buttons around the side of the map are controls
      or lead to other screens; if you want to see more of the map you can hide
      menus by selecting the wide arrow buttons at the end of the menu (and of
      course, you can select the buttons again to restore them).</p>

      <p><em>iPad only</em>: there's also a button on the bottom left corner of
      the screen that will expand or collapse all of the menus (except the speed
      menu) at once.</p>

      <p><em>Mac only</em>:  the hotkey: 'v' will also expand or collapse all of the
      menus (except the speed menu) at once.</p>

      <p>The menu on the top right side of the screen allows the user to
      navigate to the other displays in the game.  The menu just inside of it
      (the second-to-right menu along the top of the screen) controls various
      displays on the map, i.e., whether to show names (or in the case of ships,
      you can display ship classes instead of names) or other information.
      Specifically, you can enable weapons, speed, or sensor range circles (see
      <a href="#4.1.3">Circles</a>.
      If 'All Circles' is also selected, then circles for all of your ships and
      stations will be displayed (otherwise only the circles for the currently
      selected ship, station or task force will be displayed).  If the 'All
      Targets' button is selected, it will show the objectives for all of your
      ships and task forces.  Finally, if there are any ship or
      planet/asteroid-based victory conditions, a 'Show VC Targets' button will
      be present and can be used to toggle whether or not those targets are
      highlighted.</p>

      <p><em>Mac only</em>: if the game is paused and the 'Show Info' button is
      enabled, you can move the mouse over anything on the map to get more
      information about it.</p>

      <p>On the left side of the screen, between the help button and the speed
      controls, are color-coded event icons (or, if you haven't started playing
      yet, the left edge of the screen is where they'll appear when you do start
      playing).  (See
      <a href="#4.1.4">Events</a>
      below for more).  On the bottom right of the screen you can control the
      map view.  On the bottom left you can control time.   One thing to be
      aware of is that if the game is already paused and you select the pause
      button again, it will advance the clock one tick.  On the top left is the
      main menu button &mdash; that's where you can save the game or start a new
      one (or find additional help).</p>

      <p>Finally, if the game has a time limit or other victory conditions,
      buttons will appear in the center bottom of the display that will allow
      you to see those details.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.1.1">4.1.1</span> Navigating the Map</a></h4>
<p>In the bottom right corner of the tactical display are controls for
        navigating the map; the arrows will move the map around, while the plus
        and minus buttons zoom in and out, and the button with the circle in the
        middle will recenter the map.  If you've selected something (by tapping
        or clicking on it, or by selecting it from another screen or menu), you
        can also center the display on it by selecting the button at the top of
        the screen that contains the name of the item.  For ships, stations or
        task forces, if you leave the button selected it will 'lock' the screen
        on that object and follow it as the clock ticks until you select
        something else or move the map, at which point the lock will be
        lost.</p>

        <p>There are also other ways to navigate the map, but these differ by
        game platform:</p>

        <p><em>iPad</em>: the map can be moved and zoomed via pinching and
        dragging the map and should be fairly intuitive.  You can also center
        and zoom the map with a double-tap (note that you can also select items
        this way, so be careful).  The game also supports zooming out via a
        two-finger double-tap, and you can also reset/recenter the map with a
        three-finger double-tap.  However, as these gestures are slightly
        difficult to master, you can also reset/recenter the map by
        triple-tapping, or optionally zoom out with a triple-tap and
        reset/recenter with a quadruple-tap (if you turn on that option from the
        options screen).</p>

        <p><em>Mac</em>: you can also navigate via hotkeys (cursor keys to move,
        plus and minus to zoom, 'z' to recenter &mdash; also see the
        <a href="#4.1.5">Hotkeys</a>
        section below) or by dragging
        the map with the mouse.  Scrolling (via two-finger touchpad scroll or
        scroll wheel on a mouse) will zoom the map in and out, and pinch to zoom
        is supported on touchpads.  Zooming can either be centered on the mouse
        (default) or centered in the middle of the currently displayed screen
        (set on the options display).</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.1.2">4.1.2</span> Giving Orders</a></h4>
<p>When a ship or task force is selected, giving orders varies by game
        platform:</p>

        <p><em>iPad</em>: orders can either be given by holding a touch on the map
        or by selecting the 'Give Orders' button and then tapping on the
        map.</p>

        <p><em>Mac</em>: orders are given by right-clicking on the map.  This can
        be done with a right mouse button, a ctrl-click, or two fingered click
        on a touchpad.</p>

        <p>If 'Add Waypoints' is selected, waypoints will be added to the
        current orders (if possible &mdash; for instance, if current orders are
        to attack, no waypoints can be appended and new orders will be given
        instead).</p>

        <p>If you select an enemy planet or asteroid when giving orders, the
        currently selected ship or task force will be given attack orders (note
        that it's impossible to attack a neutral planet, though you can sit on a
        neutral asteroid if you really want to).  If the ship you're giving
        orders to belongs to a task force, the orders are given to the entire
        task force, not just the ship currently selected, so remember to remove
        the ship from the task force first if you want to give it independent
        orders.</p>

        <p>If you select a friendly planet or asteroid, by default the current
        ship or task force will be given defend orders.  If you select a planet
        that has a spacedock, you can then switch the orders to dock if you like
        (note that you may have to expand the overlay menu to see that option if
        you've collapsed the menu) and the currently selected ship or task force
        will return for repairs (note also that if you do this manually, any
        ships you send back to repair will not undock on their own, so you might
        want to keep an eye on your events &mdash; and make sure you haven't
        disabled the relevant event in the Events Display).  If you select a
        planet with a spacedock (or the spacedock itself) and the currently
        selected ship is damaged, the orders will default to dock instead of
        defend; in that case, all of the above caveats still apply.</p>

        <p>If you select empty space when giving orders, one of several things
        may happen: if the current selection is a task force (or one of most
        types of ships), move orders will be given.  However, if the current
        selection is a single raider, raid orders will be given.  If the current
        selection is a sentry ship, sentry orders will be given, and if the ship
        is an escort, patrol orders will be given.  You can then switch the
        order type from the overlay menu.</p>

        <p>For more on orders and order options, see
        <a href="#5.1.4">Orders and Combat</a>
        below.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.1.3">4.1.3</span> Circles</a></h4>
<p>There are three kinds of circles available on the display:</p>

        <dl><dt><em>Weapons</em></dt><dd>Weapons circles show the ranges of your ships'
        weapons: the outer circle (marked 'M') is the range of missiles, and the
        inner circle (marked 'B') is the range of beams.  If a ship isn't
        equipped with one or the other of these weapons, it won't display that
        circle.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Speed</em></dt><dd>Speed circles show the range of your ships. The
        numbers refer to the number of ticks it takes to move that far, i.e.,
        the circle marked 20 would take 20 ticks or 0.2 years to reach.  The
        same goes for stations, although of course only along their
        orbit.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Sensors</em></dt><dd>Sensor circles show the approximate range of
        your sensors; the inner circle (marked 0.25) corresponds to the range
        for raiders, the middle for escorts (1.0) and the outer circle (5.0) for
        assault ships.  Various factors (such as nebulas, enemy tech levels and
        commanders) can affect the actual ranges, however.</dd></dl>

        <p>Note that if 'All Circles' is selected, it will show circles for all
        of your ships and stations, otherwise only the circles for the currently
        selected ship or station, or circles for the ships in the currently
        selected task force will be displayed.</p>

        <p><em>Mac only</em>: if 'Show Info' and circles are active at the same
        time, range circles for the current warship will also be displayed under
        the mouse pointer.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.1.4">4.1.4</span> Events</a></h4>
<p>Event icons show up along the left side of the screen when various
        events occur during the game (see the Events Display for more
        information on how to control when they appear).  The events have
        tooltips that appear if you hover over them (<em>Mac</em>) or hold them
        down (<em>iPad</em>).  If you select an event, it will select the object
        that triggered the event (e.g., the planet that built a ship, or maybe
        the ship that's taking damage) on the tactical display.  If it's already
        selected, selecting the event again will center and focus on it.  If you
        have more events than fit on the screen, a button with three arrows will
        appear above the events icons; if you click on it, the event icons will
        expand into multiple rows on the display allowing you to manipulate them
        (you can toggle the same button again to close them if you like, or it
        will automatically disappear once you've dismissed enough event icons
        that it's no longer needed).</p>

        <p>If you're done with an event you can right-click on it to make it
        disappear (<em>Mac</em> &mdash; this can be done with a right mouse
        button, a ctrl-click, or two fingered click on a touchpad) or dismiss it
        from the tooltip menu after you hold it down (<em>iPad</em> &mdash; you'll
        also be given options to dismiss all events of the same type or all
        events).</p>

        <p><em>iPad only</em>: there is an options available in the options
        display that will insert a 'close' button before or after the events
        (depending on if you select the option to show it first or last).  That
        button will allow you to close all events at once.</p>

        <p><em>Mac only</em>: shift right-click will dismiss all events of the
        same type (or all events if you've selected that option in the options
        screen).</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.1.5">4.1.5</span> Hotkeys</a></h4>
<p><em>Mac only</em>: the following hotkeys all work on the tactical
        display:</p>

<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.2">4.2</span> Other Displays</a></h3>
<p>Several of the following displays (Officers, Ships, Task Forces,
      Planets, and Asteroids) all have some behavior in common: first, they all
      have filters along the left side of the screen.  There are tooltips for
      these filters, and the filters often come in sets that can be set
      independently (as you can see by the boxes behind them).  For instance, on
      the Officers Display, you can filter the display to only show unassigned
      commanders or maybe admirals with current assignments.</p>

      <p>The sort buttons along the top also have a direction which can be
      reversed if the sort button is selected a second time.  In the case of the
      Officers screen, the last sort button will cycle through the various
      officer skills as well.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.2.1">4.2.1</span> Officer Display</a></h4>
<p>This page shows all of your officers (which you need to command
        ships, stations, and task forces).  As with several other pages, filters
        are along the left side of the page (you can use tooltips to see what
        they do, or refer to the list below) and you can use the buttons across
        the top of the page to control sorting (note that the last button will
        cycle through the various officer skills).  Skills are listed for each
        officer (for more information on those skills, see
        <a href="#5.2">Officers</a>,
        and you can use the embedded
        buttons to promote, demote, assign or remove officers when the option is
        available (note that normally you'll be asked to confirm promotions and
        demotions; if you'd like to disable this, see the options screen).</p>

        <p>The following filter sets are available:</p>

        <p>Box 1:</p>

        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-assign-officer.png" class="tsc-control" /> show unassigned officers<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-unassign-officer.png" class="tsc-control" /> show assigned officers

        <p>Box 2:</p>

        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-admiral.png" class="tsc-control" />
        show admirals<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-captain.png" class="tsc-control" />

        show commanders<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-ltcommander.png" class="tsc-control" />
        show lt. commanders

        <p>The following actions are available:</p>

        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-promote.png" class="tsc-control" />
        promote officer<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-demote.png" class="tsc-control" />
        demote officer<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-assign-officer.png" class="tsc-control" /> assign officer to a command<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-unassign-officer.png" class="tsc-control" /> remove officer from their current
        command

        <p></p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.2.2">4.2.2</span> Ship Display</a></h4>
<p>This page shows all of your ships and stations.  As with several
        other pages, filters are along the left side of the page (you can use
        tooltips to see what they do, or refer to the list below) and you can
        use the buttons across the top of the page to control sorting.  For each
        ship, you can use the buttons to assign (or remove) officers, add ships
        to (or remove ships from) a task force (the same button also undocks the
        ship from a station), rename the ship, or find the ship on the tactical
        display.</p>

        <p>A couple of additional things to note: the green flag under a ship's
        symbol indicates that it is the flagship of its task force.  Also, if
        the ship has any 'kills' in battle, that's indicated by orange squares
        at the bottom of that ship's box.</p>

        <p>The following filter sets are available:</p>

        <p>Box 1:</p>

        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-assign-officer.png" class="tsc-control" /> show ships without commanders<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-unassign-officer.png" class="tsc-control" /> show ships with commanders

        <p>Box 2:</p>

        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-assign-tf.png" class="tsc-control" />
        show ships not assigned to a task force (or docked in a station)<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-unassign-tf.png" class="tsc-control" />
        show ships assigned to a task force (or docked in a station)

        <p>Box 3:</p>

        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-ship.png" class="tsc-control" />
        cycle through the classes of ships, starting with assault ships<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-station.png" class="tsc-control" />
        show stations

        <p>Box 4:</p>

        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-orders.png" class="tsc-control" />
        show ships with no orders<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-combat.png" class="tsc-control" />
        show ships with damage or are in combat

        <p>The following actions are available:</p>

        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-assign-officer.png" class="tsc-control" />
        assign an officer to assign that ship or station<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-unassign-officer.png" class="tsc-control" />
        remove the officer currently commanding that ship or station<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-assign-tf.png" class="tsc-control" />
        assign ship to a task force<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-unassign-tf.png" class="tsc-control" />
        remove ship from a task force (or undock if docked)<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-rename.png" class="tsc-control" />
        rename ship or station<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-find.png" class="tsc-control" />
        find that ship or station on the tactical display

        <p></p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.2.3">4.2.3</span> Task Force Display</a></h4>
<p>This page shows all of your task forces.  As with several other
        pages, filters are along the left side of the page (you can use tooltips
        to see what they do, or see below) and you can use the buttons across
        the top of the page to control sorting.  In addition, the button on the
        lower left can collapse (or expand) the list of constituent ships, and
        you can create new task forces (or change task force defaults) with the
        buttons along the top left (note that changes in task force defaults are
        saved across games).  For each task force, you can use the buttons to
        assign (or remove) officers, add available ships to the task force,
        rename it, find it on the tactical map, or disband the task force
        altogether (see the tooltips for the buttons if it isn't obvious to you
        which button is which).  Once ships are added to a task force (assuming
        you haven't used the collapse button to collapse the display) you can
        use the minus button on the right of a ship to remove it from the task
        force.</p>

        <p>The following filter sets are available:</p>

        <p>Box 1:</p>

        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-assign-officer.png" class="tsc-control" />
        show task forces without a commander<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-unassign-officer.png" class="tsc-control" /> show task forces with a commander

        <p>Box 2:</p>

        show task forces with ships<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-empty.png" class="tsc-control" />
        show empty task forces<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-orders.png" class="tsc-control" />

        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-disband.png" class="tsc-control" />
        disband task force

        <p></p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.2.4">4.2.4</span> Planetary Display</a></h4>
<p>This page shows all of your planets (which produce all of your
        ships).  As with several other pages, filters are along the left side of
        the page (you can use tooltips to see what they do, or see the list of
        filters below) and you can use the buttons across the top of the page to
        control sorting.  In addition, you can collapse (or expand) production
        queues with the button on the lower left.  For each planet, there are
        three things you can do: toggle whether or not to continue building the
        same ship when the production queue empties, add a ship (or station, or
        station upgrade) to the production queue, or find the planet on the
        tactical display.  If you toggle the repeat production setting on (it
        will say 'repeat' after the number of items in the queue after the
        planet name), whenever the queue empties, it will continue to build more
        of the last ship in the queue (as long as the last item is a ship; it
        won't continue building stations or upgrades).  If there are any items
        in the production queue, you can use the buttons to the right of the
        item to move them around in the queue or cancel production
        altogether.</p>

        <p>The following filters are available:</p>

        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-full.png" class="tsc-control" />
        show planets with production in progress<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-empty.png" class="tsc-control" />
        show planets with empty production queues<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-invasion.png" class="tsc-control" />
        show planets currently being invaded<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-metal.png" class="tsc-control" />
        show planets with insufficient metal for full production

        <p>The following actions are available:</p>

        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-rebuild.png" class="tsc-control" />
        repeat production (see above)<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-norebuild.png" class="tsc-control" />

        <p></p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.2.5">4.2.5</span> Asteroid Display</a></h4>
<p>This page shows all of your asteroids (which produce metal for your
        industry).  As with several other pages, filters are along the left side
        of the page (you can use tooltips to see what they do, or see below) and
        you can use the buttons across the top of the page to control sorting.
        There are really only a couple of things you can do from this page:
        control where asteroids ship their metal, and find the asteroid on the
        tactical display.  Metal can be shipped to any planet, including enemy
        planets &mdash; you might actually want to do this once in a while,
        since bribing players with metal will improve relations and can help
        stave off war.  Otherwise, you might want to route metal to somewhere
        besides the nearest metal-hungry planet, say if an enemy planet is in
        the way so that your cargo ships are getting intercepted (cargo ship
        pilots aren't that smart, they fly in a straight line and land on the
        first planet they reach, no matter who owns it.  Hey, they get paid
        either way).</p>

        <p>The following filters are available:</p>

        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-full.png" class="tsc-control" />
        show asteroids with no targets, i.e., asteroids that send metal to the
        nearby planet that needs it most automatically<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-empty.png" class="tsc-control" />
        show asteroids with fixed targets<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-invasion.png" class="tsc-control" />
        show asteroids currently being invaded

        <p>The following actions are available:</p>

        set target to planet, i.e., ship metal to a fixed planet<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-empty.png" class="tsc-control" />
        set target to auto, i.e., ship metal to any nearby planets that need
        it<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-find.png" class="tsc-control" />
        find asteroid on tactical display

        <p></p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.2.6">4.2.6</span> Research Display</a></h4>
<p>This is the research page; on this page you can see what research
        you've completed and set how much of your industrial production is
        directed towards research, as well as what areas you'd like to focus on.
        At the bottom of the page is a single slider controlling the percentage
        of your industrial production that will be allocated to research; note
        that if you set it to 100% you won't produce any ships at all (only
        research), and if you set it to 0%, you won't make any research progress
        whatsoever. On the top right side of the page you can modify how much
        research goes into various areas of technology using the sliders.  You
        can also lock (or unlock) each of those areas with the buttons to the
        right when editing your overall research focus.  To the left you can see
        your current level of technology in each area and your progress to the
        next level &mdash; note that reaching 100% will not automatically
        advance your tech level; instead, as progress advances past 100%,
        advancing to the next level will become more likely.</p>

        <p>Note that ships' technology levels cannot be upgraded.  This is
        offset somewhat by the experience ships will gain in combat &mdash; or
        at a slower rate, just by operating in general.  This same limitation
        does not apply to stations, which are automatically upgraded with the
        latest technologies as they become available.</p>

        <p>For more information on how research works, see the
        <a href="#5.4">Research and Upgrades</a> section
        below.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.2.7">4.2.7</span> Diplomacy Display</a></h4>
<p>This is the diplomacy page; on this page you can see what your
        current relations are with other players, and also what your current
        diplomatic status is for those players (i.e., whether you're currently
        at war, still at peace, or if the player has been eliminated).  There's
        only one action that can be taken from this page &mdash; if your
        relations are sufficiently poor (into the orange relations band) and you
        aren't already at war with a player, you can declare war on that
        player.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.2.8">4.2.8</span> Events Display</a></h4>
<p>This is the event options page; here you control how the game will
        respond to various triggered events.  For each event type you have the
        choice of the following responses (from left to right for each
        event):</p>

        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-event-pause.png" class="tsc-control" />
        Pause the game and pop up an event alert;<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-event-alert.png" class="tsc-control" />
        Pop up an event alert but don't pause the game;<br />
        <img src="../assets/tsc/manual/button-event-ignore.png" class="tsc-control" />
        Ignore the event (don't show any alert at all).

        <p>As long as at least some of these event alerts are enabled, event
        alerts appear on the left side of the tactical display during play; you
        can select the referenced object by clicking on events, or remove events
        via their tooltips by holding them down (<em>iPad</em>) or
        right-clicking (<em>Mac</em>).  Note that event options are saved across
        games, so if you change them for one game, they'll still be in effect
        the next.  The possible events are not listed here in the manual; they
        should be self-evident from the descriptions.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="4.2.9">4.2.9</span> Options Display</a></h4>
<p>This is the user options page; various aspects of game play can be
        controlled from here (for instance, the handling of officers &mdash;
        assigning officers, promoting them, etc. &mdash; can be delegated to the
        computer instead of having to micromanage everything yourself). The
        effects of various options should (hopefully) be fairly evident from the
        option descriptions but are also listed below. Note that user options
        are saved across games, so if you change them for one game, they'll
        still be in effect the next.</p>

        <p>The following options are available:</p>

        <ul>

        <li> Enable sound effects/Volume: volume can also be adjusted here; note
        that the volume is relative to system volume, so if you turn off the
        device's sound, you won't hear anything no matter how high you set
        this.</li>
        <li> Adjust gamma: this is particularly useful if you have a dimmer
        device (or prefer to keep the brightness low) but are having trouble
        seeing everything on the tactical map.</li>
        <li> Ask for confirmation before promoting or demoting officers.</li>
        <li> Assign officers of appropriate rank as needed: let the computer
        assign officers instead of handling it yourself (works best in concert
        with the next option)</li>
        <li> Promote officers as needed: let the computer promote officers when
        you're short of officers of appropriate rank (works best in concert with
        the above option)</li>
        <li> Clear orders after evading enemy ships while raiding: otherwise
        raiders will attempt to return to their ordered location once the area
        is clear</li>
        <li> Clear orders when threatened by enemy ships while on sentry duty:
        otherwise sentry ships will try to return to their station</li>
        <li> When tracking lost on ships being intercepted, switch orders to
        move to last known location (otherwise clear): basically, whether or not
        you want to chase ghosts</li>
        <li> Return repaired warships to original task force.</li>
        <li> Return repaired warships (not in task force) to original mission:
        i.e., restore old orders once repaired</li>
        <li> Continue building ships of same class when queue empties (disables
        per-planet option when set).</li>
        <li> Automatically generate random names for ships instead of using
        numbered ships: the two options here are either name ships according to
        the pattern 'TSC Name' or 'Cruiser 1' (i.e., by class name).</li>
        <li> Show ship class prefix when displaying ship names: this will insert
        a two-letter prefix before ship names, i.e., escorts would have the
        prefix '[ES]' inserted before the name</li>
        <li> Remove unacknowledged event icons after two years have passed:
        otherwise all event icons must be dismissed by you</li>
        <li> Reverse order of events (show oldest first instead of newest
        first): this restores the old 1.0.x behavior if you prefer that</li>
        <li> Automatically dismiss 'no production' event notification when new
        production added to queue: unselect to get old behavior, requiring that
        events be manually dismissed</li>
        <li> Automatically dismiss 'no orders' event notification when ship or
        task force given orders: unselect to get old behavior, requiring that
        events be manually dismissed</li>
        <li> Automatically dismiss 'no commander' event notification when
        officer assigned: unselect to get old behavior, requiring that events be
        manually dismissed</li>
        <li> Show gameplay tips on startup: tips are also available from the
        main menu (via top left on tactical display, browse help)</li>
        <li> Show tutorial/help dialogs (turning this on will reset dialogs to
        unviewed state: it will not restart the tutorial, however &mdash; that
        needs to be launched from the new game screen</li>
        <li> Enable transparency on tactical display overlay menus.</li>
        <li> Enable red-green colorblind friendly palette.</li>

        </ul>

        <p><em>iPad only</em>:</p>

        <ul>

        <li> Automatically switch to order mode when ships or task forces
        selected: this will set it so the next touch on the map will give an
        order (better disabled if you prefer to long-touch to give orders)</li>
        <li> Automatically switch to select mode when ships or task forces give
        orders: otherwise you need to be very careful to unselect the 'Give
        Order' button after you're done giving orders</li>
        <li> Triple-tap zooms out (if selected, quadruple-tap centers map,
        otherwise triple-tap does).</li>
        <li> Include 'Close All' button with events: displays a button after all
        the events that allows you to dismiss them with one button</li>
        <li> If 'Close All' set, button comes first.</li>

        </ul>

        <p><em>Mac only</em>:</p>

        <ul>

        <li> Shift-right-click dismisses all events (otherwise dismisses all of
        same type).</li>
        <li> Zoom in on cursor (zooms on center of screen when disabled).</li>

        <p class="indent-override">[1] Production time in factory-years at
        level zero production technology.<br />
        [2] Each station level upgrade costs 5 factory-years and increases
        shields and beams an additional 2 points, armor and missiles an
        additional 1 point.  The station's profile also increase 2 points.</p>

        <p>All listed values at level zero of relevant technology.</p>

        <dl><dt><em>Station</em></dt><dd>A station is not a ship, it's simply a
        weapons platform orbiting a planet.  All stations defending a planet
        must be destroyed before a planet can be invaded.  Up to six stations
        can be built per planet.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Spacedock</em></dt><dd>A spacedock is station that can also
        repair ships (and allows ships to be built by a planet).  Only one
        spacedock can be built per planet.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Escort</em></dt><dd>Fast with good sensors, but lightly
        armed. Ideal for hunting down raiders and patrol duty, can be used to
        soften up targets for larger warships but generally don't last long in
        that role. Cheap enough that you can easily replace them when
        destroyed.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Raider</em></dt><dd>Very lightly armed but difficult to
        detect. Ideal for sneaking into enemy territory to destroy unarmed enemy
        shipping.  Useless for any sort of combat against enemy
        warships.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Sentry Ship</em></dt><dd>Unarmed and fragile but difficult
        to detect; carries the longest ranged sensors in the game.  Use to help
        hunt down raiders or to keep an eye on enemy fleet movements at the edge
        of your territory.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Cruiser</em></dt><dd>The backbone of most fleets;
        reasonably powerful without being prohibitively expensive.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Missile Cruiser</em></dt><dd>Slow but powerful, primarily
        intended as a counter to dreadnoughts and heavily upgraded
        stations.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Assault Ship</em></dt><dd>Used for assaulting enemy planets
        and asteroids; the only ship that can capture them.  However, it is
        expensive, slow and not heavily armed, and should be protected from
        enemy attack.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Dreadnought</em></dt><dd>The heaviest (and most expensive)
        line warship in the game; can inflict and withstand tremendous amounts
        of damage.  Ideal for grinding up enemy ships.  Essentially just a
        cruiser but larger.</dd></dl>

        <p>A sensor ghost is not a ship at all, it is the last known position of
        a ship on the tactical display.  As such, they can't be attacked by your
        ships; you can only send your ships to the area you think it might have
        moved (or not moved).  As time passes, sensor ghosts will fade out until
        they disappear.  Likewise, when you lose sensor locks on stations, they
        will also fade out; however, unlike ships, since stations' orbits are
        well-known, the correct location of the station can continue to be
        plotted.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.1.2">5.1.2</span> Weapons and Defenses and Other Stats</a></h4>
<p>There are two types of weapons in the game: beams and missiles.
        Missiles have twice the range of beams, but beams do twice the damage.
        However, missiles have one other advantage over beams: the larger the
        target, the more likely the missiles are to penetrate shields and do
        direct damage to armor instead of just dissipating against shields like
        beam weapons do.  This effect is very unlikely against small ships such
        as escorts (and even against dreadnoughts it happens less than half the
        time), but the general upshot is that missiles tend to be more effective
        against larger targets and beams against smaller ones.</p>

        <p>There are also two types of defenses: shields and armor.  The
        difference here is that shields will regenerate during combat, but any
        damage to armor must be repaired in a spacedock.  The exception is for
        stations, which can repair their own armor (however, they do so much,
        much more slowly than they regenerate their shields).</p>

        <p>The effect of speed should be fairly obvious.  Faster ships go
        farther more quickly.</p>

        <p>Sensors are also fairly obvious.  The flip side is ship profile:
        ships with smaller profiles are proportionally harder to detect.</p>

        <p>One other note: ships' crews will also gain experience in combat, and
        as they do so they will gain some small boost in combat effectiveness.
        There really isn't an easy way to see how experienced a ship is except
        if it happens to have destroyed a lot of enemy ships (which are marked
        with orange squares on the Ships Display), but it does slightly offset
        the fact that tech upgrades only affect new ships you build, not older
        ones &mdash; there's no way to refit older ships with new
        technology.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.1.3">5.1.3</span> Invasions</a></h4>
<p>Planetary invasions are fairly difficult for a couple of reasons:
        first, to effectively attack a planet you have to drop into orbit so you
        don't have as much control over combat near planets as you would
        otherwise.  If you don't drop your ships into orbit (i.e., set the enemy
        planet as the ship/task force's objective), any ships near a planet but
        not in orbit will fight at a severe disadvantage against orbiting
        defenders.  The second reason is that heavily upgraded stations are
        difficult to destroy, as they can be upgraded fairly cheaply but punch
        at the level of two or three dreadnoughts when fully upgraded.  That may
        not seem like so much, except that (assuming you let them) even
        dreadnoughts will retreat when taking sufficient damage while stations
        never can &mdash; and even doing 99% damage is not sufficient if the
        attacking fleet breaks off before finishing the job.  That said,
        stations are still vulnerable to being swarmed and even when a planet
        has six stations defending it, since stations are too far apart to
        support each other, as weapon ranges are not long enough to reach the
        next station.</p>

        <p>In both the case of planetary and asteroid invasions, you need
        assault ships to actually capture them.  In both cases the defending
        fleets need to be destroyed or driven off and no planetary invasion can
        begin until all the defending stations are destroyed.  It's a good idea
        to attack with multiple assault ships if you can, since the longer an
        invasion takes, the more damage is done to existing infrastructure, and
        the longer it takes to rebuild afterwards.  That said, given enough
        time, a planet's mining and industry will eventually reach the level it
        was at before the invasion &mdash; the destruction is never
        permanent.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.1.4">5.1.4</span> Orders and Combat</a></h4>
<p>The following types of orders are available in the game:</p>

        <dl><dt><em>Move</em></dt><dd>If you select a point on the map, this is
        the default type of order. If this order is assigned, the ships will
        move to the destination regardless of the situation; they will fire at
        enemy ships in range, but they will not otherwise pursue or avoid
        them.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Patrol</em></dt><dd>Ships given this order will move to
        their destination. However, if they detect enemy ships near the
        destination, they will pursue them (assuming they aren't outclassed
        &mdash; for instance, an escort will chase a raider, but if they see a
        dreadnought, they would leave it alone).  You can control the pursuit
        options for this order: if pursuit is set to 'Conservative' the ship
        will tend to hold position (i.e., not chase enemies very far) and
        prioritize protecting the area around the destination.  If pursuit is
        set to 'Aggressive' it will chase the enemy as long as it has a sensor
        lock to the ends of the universe (which might leave the destination
        unprotected for other raiders, though, or otherwise disrupt an
        established picket line).  'Normal' is somewhere in the middle &mdash;
        it will pursue for a distance and then break off.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Raid</em></dt><dd>Ships given this order will move to their
        destination. However, they will avoid any ships they detect along the
        way &mdash; any time they are approached by enemy ships, they will bug
        out.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Sentry</em></dt><dd>This order is the same as raid, except
        the ships aren't as paranoid about bugging out; they won't move to avoid
        enemy ships until they get relatively close.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Attack</em></dt><dd>This order applies to planets or
        asteroids.  The main difference between asteroid and planet attacks
        involves formations &mdash; for asteroids you have complete control over
        formation shape and closing distance, for planets ships need to be in
        orbit for maximum combat efficiency.  You can also control how
        aggressive your captains are allowed to be when they detect secondary
        targets en route (or fleeing in the case of asteroid attacks) &mdash;
        the options are 'Aggressive', 'Conservative', or 'Hold Formation' in
        which case they aren't allowed to break formation at all.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Defend</em></dt><dd>This order also applies to planets or
        asteroids.  Again, the difference is how formations are handled.  See
        <a href="#5.3.1">Formations</a>
        for more information on that.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Dock</em></dt><dd>Send the ship/task force back for
        repairs.  In the options display, you can set if you'd like this to
        happen automatically when ships are damaged, and whether you'd like
        ships automatically returned to their task force or orders when they're
        done repairing.  Ships given dock orders will also avoid enemy ships on
        the way back home.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Intercept</em></dt><dd>This order applies to enemy ships
        (you can't use it on sensor ghosts, though, since ships can only pursue
        things they can see &mdash; there is an option to move to the last known
        location instead of breaking off pursuit if sensor lock is lost, but the
        drawback to that is that the ships will just sit there when they arrive
        and will need to be given new orders before they'll do anything).
        Similar to attack, you can also control how your ships respond to
        secondary targets of opportunity, whether to aggressively chase them or
        ignore them completely.</dd></dl>

        <p>Certain types of ships will default to certain types of orders: i.e.,
        when you select a point on the map that isn't a ship, planet or asteroid
        to give an order, normally move orders will be assigned, but if the ship
        is a raider, it will default to raid orders; if it's a sentry ship, it
        will default to sentry orders; and if it's an escort, it will default to
        patrol orders.  Of course, you can always change the order type from the
        order overlay menu.</p>

        <p>No matter what orders are given, combat will always occur when enemy
        ships are in range.  You can see this on the map by zooming in on the
        area of combat; ships being hit by beams or missiles will show a shield
        arc (even if they don't actually have shields &mdash; the tactical map
        is an abstraction, not a direct representation of reality), with
        missiles being marked by red lines intercepting it and beams by yellow
        ones (though if you see beams, if the attack ship also has missiles,
        both types of weapons will be engaged).  You can also turn the weapons
        range circles on to get a better idea of what's going on; see
        <a href="#4.1.3">Circles</a> above.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.1.5">5.1.5</span> Navigational Hazards</a></h4>
<p>There are two basic types of navigational hazard in the game:
        nebulas and debris fields.  Nebulas are marked with gray circles and
        degrade sensors both when ships are inside of them and when attempting
        to detect ships in them.  Debris fields are marked with roughly textured
        circles and slow the progress of all ships passing through them,
        including freighters.</p>

        <p>Both types of fields can be of varying densities, and have effects
        proportional to those densities.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.2">5.2</span> Officers</a></h3>
<p>Officers are not something you really need to deal with unless you
      want to &mdash; by default, the computer will promote and assign officers
      as needed.  However, do note that the computer won't really spend a lot of
      effort optimizing officer assignments, either.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.2.1">5.2.1</span> Ranks</a></h4>
<p>There are four ranks in the game, they are as follows:</p>

        <dl><dt><em>Admiral</em></dt><dd>Admirals are required to command task
        forces; no lower rank will do.  Admirals are marked with four
        chevrons.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Captain</em></dt><dd>Capital ships (also spacedocks) require
        captains to command them.  Captains are marked with three
        chevrons.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Commander</em></dt><dd>Commanders can command smaller ships
        such as escorts, raiders, or regular stations.  Commanders are marked
        with two chevrons.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Lt. Commander</em></dt><dd>These are essential candidate
        officers for higher ranks; promote the best to command your ships,
        stations, and task forces.  Lt. Commanders only have one
        chevron.</dd></dl>

        <p>Note that higher ranked officers can command lower commands, but it's
        not particularly efficient to do so, since higher ranked officers don't
        gain experience as quickly as lower ranked officers would.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.2.2">5.2.2</span> Skills and Experience</a></h4>
<p>There are four types of skills that an officer can have, as well as
        experience.  The skills are: attack skill, which obviously affects the
        offensive capabilities of a ship commanded by that officer, i.e., beams
        and weapons.  Defense skill can increase the speed at which shields
        regenerate (and increase the chance of dodging missiles).  Engineering
        skill allows commanders to run their engines more efficiently (i.e.,
        faster), increases their ship's effective sensor range, and if the
        officer commands a spacedock, increases the speed of repairs in that
        spacedock.  Finally, command skill only applies to admirals, but the
        higher their skill, the more effectively they can apply their other
        skills to all of the ships under their command.</p>

        <p>Experience, on the other hand, is not a skill, but allows skills to
        be utilized.  That is, a commander with high skill but no experience
        cannot apply their skill, but a commander with high experience but no
        skill is in the same position because they have no skill to effectively
        apply.  The best thing to have is a commander with both high skill and
        high experience, since those skills can be applied effectively.</p>

        <p>Any officer given a post will gain experience, although officers
        involved in combat will gain experience much more quickly than officers
        simply commanding a ship or station.  Also, lower-ranked officers gain
        skill more quickly than higher-ranked ones.  Finally, when an officer is
        new and inexperienced, their skills are not yet well-known; this
        uncertainty is indicated by the orange part of their skill bar (i.e.,
        their skill is somewhere in the orange range, but until the officer gets
        more experienced, it isn't known where yet).  As an officer gains
        experience, that uncertainty will also drop, eventually disappearing
        altogether.  Another thing to consider is that anytime you promote an
        officer to a higher rank, that officer will lose a portion of their
        experience (you can get some of it back by demoting the officer, but
        never quite as much as they lost in the first place).  Their skills,
        however, will not change, and eventually they will gain experience back
        in their new rank (assuming that you've assigned them somewhere).</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.2.3">5.2.3</span> Losing Officers in Combat</a></h4>
<p>Whenever you lose a ship in combat, there is a chance you'll also
        lose the commanding officer.  Even worse, if that ship is the flagship
        of a task force, you could lose the admiral in command of the task force
        as well.</p>

        <p>The odds of losing your officer depends mainly on how close you lose
        it to surviving ships (or a planet under your control).  I.e., if you
        lose a ship (say, a raider) deep in enemy territory, the odds are pretty
        low that the captain may have escaped and that you'll recover the escape
        pod.  The odds are much better if the ship is part of a large task force
        with other ships available for rescue operations, or if the ship (or
        station) is in orbit of one of your planets.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.3">5.3</span> Task Forces</a></h3>
<p>Task forces are a handy way to organize your ships and give them
      objectives.  The advantages of having a task force include the ability to
      assign admirals (who can give a skill boost to everyone under their
      command) as well as assigning formations to your ships to aid in effective
      attacks or defensive stands.  That said, there are cases where having a
      task force is probably not a good idea, say for raiders or sentry ships
      which work better alone (in which case giving one ship an admiral doesn't
      confer enough benefit to be worth the risk of losing that officer if the
      ship is lost.  Not to mention the fact that a skill boost would barely
      make any difference in the effectiveness of those ships at their tasks
      even if it was more significant than it is).</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.3.1">5.3.1</span> Formations</a></h4>
<p>Task forces can be given various formations in the game depending on
        circumstances and specific orders.  The following formations are
        available:</p>

        <dl><dt><em>No Formation - Best Speed</em></dt><dd>This formation is
        only available when intercepting enemy ships or moving; basically this
        is a lack of formation and all ships in the task force will move at
        maximum speed towards the target/destination.</dd></dl>

        <p>The following formations are only available for planetary combat
        (i.e., attacking or defending planets &mdash; for both of these, assault
        ships will always be in the center where they're most protected/engage
        last):</p>

        <dl><dt><em>Escort Out</em></dt><dd>Lighter ships lead and trail, will
        hopefully soften up the targets before larger ships engage.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Capital Out</em></dt><dd>The heavier ships lead and trail
        and so will engage first.</dd></dl>

        <p>The following formations are available for movement and asteroid
        attack/defense (in the case of line formations used for attacks, assault
        ships will form an additional line behind the other ships &mdash;
        assault ships aren't ideal for defense and probably should be left out
        of those task forces altogether).</p>

        <dl><dt><em>Sphere</em></dt><dd>Ships will form concentric circles with
        the heaviest ships in the middle.  In the case of asteroid defense,
        ships will instead form a circle around the asteroid with the heaviest
        ships in the center oriented towards attacking fleets.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Line</em></dt><dd>Ships will form a single line, heaviest
        ships in the center</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Two Line - Escort Ahead</em></dt><dd>Ships will form two
        lines, heaviest ships in the center, escorts in front</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Two Line - Capital Ahead</em></dt><dd>Ships will form two
        lines, heaviest ships in the center, escorts behind</dd></dl>

        <p>In all cases, you can control your ship spacing, from 'Tight' to
        'Normal' to 'Loose'.  Tight is generally good if you want to maximize
        damage inflicted (at the cost of taking more), loose is better for
        minimizing damage to your ships (or perhaps surrounding a planet if you
        have enough ships so that you can engage enemy ships before they make
        orbit).  For asteroid attacks or defense, you can also attempt to close
        to a particular distance (although whether you actually succeed or not
        at engaging at a a particular distance depends on what your opponent
        chooses to do).</p>

        <p>In addition to force disposition, the formation controls also allow
        you to control when ships go back to spacedock for repairs.  If you have
        the formation controls up on the tactical display and have any damaged
        ships in the current task force, you can also send any damaged ships
        back for repairs immediately regardless of what the current auto-repair
        threshold is set to.</p>

        <p>You can set formation defaults in the Task Force Display (see the
        'Task Force Defaults' button along the top of the display) &mdash; those
        defaults will apply to all future orders, but will not affect any orders
        already given (note that saved defaults are persistent, so the next game
        will use the same defaults).  Also, remember that when you give commands
        to any ship in a task force, you're giving it to the whole task force,
        so if you want to give a ship independent orders, remember to detach it
        from the task force first.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.3.2">5.3.2</span> Other Considerations</a></h4>
<p>When building new ships, you can have them automatically assigned to
        a task force (perhaps a reserve task force or one you use for staging
        your attacks). This option is available any time one of your planets is
        selected on the tactical display.</p>

        <p>Note that task forces organize around their flagship; this can have
        unintended consequences when a new flagship is assigned (say, a new
        heavy ship is built and automatically assigned, or repaired in a
        spacedock and rejoins the fleet).  If the rest of the fleet is far away
        somewhere else on the map, you may see them all racing back across the
        map to get back into formation around the new flagship.  In that case,
        it might be a good idea to form up your task force somewhere safe before
        sending them in to attack.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.4">5.4</span> Research and Upgrades</a></h3>
<p>Research works very simply in the game; you select a percentage of
      your industrial capacity and apply it to research.  Of course, if you set
      it too high, it can significantly slow (or even completely halt) your
      warship production.  Also, even if you don't assign a planet anything to
      produce, it will still only use the set percentage for research, the rest
      of that planet's production will sit idle (although it will save
      metal).</p>

      <p>Research also advances very slowly.  Reaching 100% to the next level
      isn't enough by itself to tick the level over; instead the chance of
      advancing to the next level continues to increase as you go past 100%.
      Also, it takes a lot of research to increase the stats of new ships you
      build; each level will only increase them by 2%, so it takes fifty levels
      for a 1.0 point stat to reach 2.0 (and research will slow slightly as you
      advance as well &mdash; there's no maximum level, however, so that
      theoretically research can advance forever, even if it gets slower and
      slower).</p>

      <p>For the most part, what effect research has should be fairly obvious.
      Shields increase the shield stats for new construction, armor, missiles,
      beams, and sensors are the same.  Engines increase ship's speed.  The more
      interesting ones are stealth, which slowly lowers ships' profiles (making
      them harder to detect) and production, which increases the rate at which
      you can build things.</p>

      <p>For the most part, tech increases do not affect existing ships &mdash;
      the exception is for stations which will be upgraded with the latest and
      greatest tech.  Ships' crews, however, will gain experience, which helps
      to offset that effect somewhat.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.5">5.5</span> Economy and Commerce Raiding</a></h3>
<p></p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.5.1">5.5.1</span> How the Economy Works</a></h4>
<p>Economics in the game is fairly simple: there is only one resource,
        metal.  Metal is produced by asteroids (and on some planets) and then
        shipped via freighters (shown on the map as lines of dots between their
        source and destination) to planets that need it to run their factories
        (industry).  Without metal, industry will sit idle and no production
        will occur.  Adequately supplied industry can produce ships, stations,
        or station upgrades.  That's really all there is to it.</p>

        <p>By default, asteroids will send metal to whatever nearby planets need
        it most.  You can override that if, say, if you're trying to minimize
        trade routes.  In addition, planets with large surpluses of metal will
        also ship it to nearby planets (occasionally to each other if you're
        swimming in metal &mdash; lucky you), but you don't have any control
        over that if and when it occurs.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.5.2">5.5.2</span> Commerce Raiders and Counters</a></h4>
<p>Commerce raiding is generally best done with raiders (although any
        warship will destroy enemy freighters in range).  Pretty much all there
        is to it is sending your raiders to sit on a line of freighters
        somewhere &mdash; any freighter within missile range will be destroyed
        (you might check the weapons circle for your raider to line things up).
        Although there isn't any direct feedback when you succeed, you can count
        up freighters destroyed on the score display in the main menu &mdash; if
        you see a line of enemy freighters coming into missile range and
        stopping, that's what's going on.  Do note that raiders given raid
        orders will bug out at the slightest provocation to save their hides and
        come back to raid another day, but given how fragile the ships are,
        that's probably how you want it.</p>

        <p>You're given a lot more feedback when your own freighters are
        destroyed so that you can do something about it; there is an event that
        will fire anytime you're losing shipping.  In that case, you probably
        want to send escorts to patrol that area and hunt raiders.  While it's
        nice when you successfully destroy enemy raiders (and with enough effort
        and planning, and support from sentry ships, it's almost always possible
        &mdash; the question is more if it's worth the resources to do so),
        simply leaving escorts at key points along your trade routes will
        prevent your shipping from being attacked (which is really the goal,
        when you get down to it).  In many cases, you might consider that good
        enough.  There are any number of strategies you might try, from ignoring
        shipping losses altogether (probably not a good idea) to only responding
        when you actually lose shipping, to aggressively hunting and trapping
        raiders, to simply building a perimeter around your territory to keep
        them out.  Given that every ship sent to chase raiders is a ship not
        available for offensive operations, how you balance that is up to
        you.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.6">5.6</span> Diplomacy</a></h3>
<p>This being, well, a tactical space combat command game, diplomacy
      isn't really an important part of the game, and in fact, some scenarios go
      straight to war without any setup time.  That said, there are a few things
      to know.</p>

      <p>First, there are no alliances; in games with multiple computer players,
      eventually everyone will end up fighting everyone else.  There are also no
      peace treaties &mdash; once war starts, it's a fight to the end.</p>

      <p>Second, there are some minor ways that you can influence how quickly
      you go to war.  If you send metal from your asteroids to neutral planets,
      you can slow down (or possibly even reverse) the countdown to war.  On the
      other hand, if you send ships into 'enemy territory' early (i.e.,
      somewhere between their planets and/or asteroids), you can speed up the
      countdown.  And, of course, once relations have gone negative, you can
      always start war immediately.  As long as relations stay negative,
      however, war is inevitable &mdash; and the worse they are, the higher the
      chance that the computer player will declare war any given turn.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="5.7">5.7</span> Managing Events</a></h3>
<p>TSC isn't exactly a turn-based game and it isn't exactly an RTS, it's
      more of a quantum RTS where things happen every discrete tick of the
      clock.  As such, much of the time you'll just want to let the clock go
      until something important happens, but events can stop the game and tell
      you that there's something you need to deal with.</p>

      <p>There are events for practically everything that happens in the game
      (and some of them may only seem subtly different, like having an event
      both for when a ship is engaged in combat and when a ship is taking
      damage, but depending on how you play, you may want to use one or the
      other or maybe even both).  Events allow you to customize how you play and
      when you might want to intervene, i.e., what you want to be told about and
      what is important enough to stop everything so you can respond to it.
      There are, however, a few things to be aware of: one, if an event has
      already fired once and not been dismissed, it will not fire again for the
      same object.  E.g., if an enemy starts an assault on an asteroid, but you
      drive them off, if you leave the event up without dismissing it, it will
      not fire again when they return and start a new assault.  Likewise, if a
      ship is in combat, only one event will fire until that event is dismissed,
      no matter how much more combat that ship sees.  The other thing to be
      aware of is that if you disable a whole bunch of events (say, at the end
      of the game), they'll still be disabled at the beginning of the next game,
      so if you tend to do that you might want to reset a few things when you
      start a new game.</p>
<h2><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="6">6</span> Scenario Editor</a></h2>
<p>The scenario editor allows the user to create and share their own
    scenarios, or modify the new scenarios that were added with v1.2 of Tactical
    Space Command (the new scenarios were all created using the editor; the
    older scenarios are all generated internally by the game instead so they
    can't be loaded into the editor).  It can be reached from the new game
    screen.</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="6.1">6.1</span> Editor Screens</a></h3>
<p></p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="6.1.1">6.1.1</span> Editor Map Display</a></h4>
<p>The editor map display shows the scenario map.  On this screen you
        can create, delete, move, or edit all of the game objects such as
        planets, asteroids, ships, nebulas, and debris/asteroid fields.  It's
        navigated pretty much the same way the regular map is &mdash; there are
        navigation controls on the bottom right, and you can go to the other
        screens with the buttons at the top right, or control the display.</p>

        <p>There are three editing modes, each of which is indicated by a button
        at the top left.  'Drag Map' allows you to manipulate the map view
        itself by dragging it (and can also keep you from accidentally moving
        objects as you edit), 'Drag Object' allows you to manipulate &mdash;
        i.e., move &mdash; the map objects via dragging, and 'Add Objects'
        allows you to add new objects to the map.  The '+' button locks the
        latter mode so you can add several objects at a time, otherwise it will
        switch to 'Drag Object' after you add something.  You can also change
        the grid distance; that's also the distance the move buttons move
        objects on the map.  Finally, the grid display can be toggled by
        clicking on the grid size button itself.</p>

        <p>If there are any problems with the scenario, a row of alert buttons
        will appear along the bottom of the screen; to find out the details, you
        can select one of those buttons.</p>

        <p>When an object is selected, you can control its parameters from the
        menu that appears.  If alternate victory conditions are selected, you
        can set (or unset) ships or planets and asteroids as victory objectives
        with the star button at the bottom left of the menu.  To rename the
        object, select the button with its name.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="6.1.2">6.1.2</span> Scenario Parameters Display</a></h4>
<p>This scenario editor parameters display is used to configure the
        scenario metadata.  From here you can select how many/what players are
        in the scenario, the starting relations (or whether the players start at
        war), and the map size, name, and description of the scenario.</p>

        <p>The buttons on the bottom right are used to decide whether the ship
        and planet names (and players) are the ones you set in the scenario
        editor, or whether names and players will instead be randomly generated
        when the scenario is loaded for play.</p>

        <p>You can control the AI parameters (and keep them from changing or
        not) by selecting the button with the name of the computer player.  You
        can also set different victory conditions with the victory conditions
        button at the bottom of the display.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="6.1.3">6.1.3</span> Custom AI Display</a></h4>
<p>This is the screen that controls all of the AI settings and is
        available (via the parameters screen) for each of the computer players.
        One thing to keep in mind is that the AI will sometimes try different
        strategies (especially if it's losing lots of planets or asteroids).
        You can prevent that with the 'Fixed Strategy' button at the bottom
        left.</p>

        <p>The following parameters are available (note that for the most part,
        these strategies aren't really absolute; instead they shift the balance
        of the AI's default tendencies):</p>

        <dl><dt><em>Production Strategy</em></dt><dd>This controls what
        proportion of production will be allocated towards ships or stations:
        using this parameter can tip the needle a little more towards one or the
        other than the computer normally would.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Station Strategy</em></dt><dd>Using this you can nudge the
        computer more towards creating new stations or upgrading the stations it
        already has.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Ship Strategy</em></dt><dd>With this, you can direct the
        computer to build more (or sometimes, less) of a particular class of
        ships.  It will still create all of the ship classes as needed, just in
        different proportions than it normally would.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Posture Strategy</em></dt><dd>This controls to what extent
        the computer will build large defensive garrisons, rather than holding
        back ships for counter-attacks.  Note that if you emphasize garrisons,
        if the computer does not have enough ships, it will have difficulty
        allocating garrisons if it has a large number of targets to defend (in
        particular, a large number of asteroids).  For that reason, if the
        computer starts with few ships (or has a lot of asteroids to defend),
        it's generally better to emphasize counter-attacks.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Aggression Strategy</em></dt><dd>This controls how
        aggressively the computer will play, i.e., whether it will attack when
        it sees a slight advantage, or whether it will wait and attack with more
        overwhelming force.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Research Strategy</em></dt><dd>This controls what proportion
        of production the computer will direct towards research.  Obviously,
        research tends to be wasted in shorter games; if the game will more
        likely go longer, research is more useful.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Research Emphasis Strategy</em></dt><dd>This controls what
        particular area of research the computer will emphasize.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Target Selection Strategy</em></dt><dd>This controls what
        sorts of targets (i.e., planets or asteroids) the computer will tend to
        target, with an emphasis on either the nearest targets, the least
        defended targets, or asteroids first.  Regardless of strategy, the
        computer will take distance and garrison strength into account; this
        only shifts the balance.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Victory Planet Attack Strategy</em></dt><dd>This controls
        how much the computer will emphasize victory condition planets or
        asteroids on the attack (in addition to the factors above).</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Victory Planet Defense Strategy</em></dt><dd>This controls
        whether or not the computer will put larger garrisons on victory
        condition planets and asteroids; note that if the computer is short of
        ships, this could easily suck away ships used for attack or for
        defending other planets and asteroids, so use carefully.</dd></dl>

        <dl><dt><em>Victory Ship Attack Strategy</em></dt><dd>This controls
        whether the computer will target ships designated as victory conditions.
        Note that there are no options for computer-controlled victory condition
        ships (i.e., it will always treat them as normal).</dd></dl>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="6.1.4">6.1.4</span> Custom Victory Conditions Display</a></h4>
<p>On this display (reachable via the parameters screen), you can
        modify what conditions are used to define victory and defeat.  You can
        also set a timer that will end the game (again either as a win or a
        loss, depending on which condition you choose).  If ships or planets are
        chosen as victory conditions, you'll need to select some on the editor
        map to fulfill the conditions.</p>
<h4><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="6.1.5">6.1.5</span> File Manager Display</a></h4>
<p>Most of the scenario editor file manager display should be fairly
        obvious; 'Load' loads the scenario into memory, 'Save' saves over the
        listed file, 'Delete' deletes the file, 'Save New' in the side menu
        saves the currently loaded file as a new file. System scenarios are also
        listed on this screen (in orange, with [system] appended to the file
        name).  These can't be overwritten or deleted for obvious reasons, but
        you can load them into the editor, and if you then save the scenario,
        you can have a user scenario with the same name.  You also can't save
        invalid scenarios (which is indicated by an alert button on the bottom
        right).  In that case, you'll need to correct the scenario before saving
        it.  However, if you haven't finished creating your scenario and quit
        the game, it will autosave the scenario and you can pick it up from the
        scenario editor once you restart.</p>

        <p>There are some differences with how files are handled between the Mac
        and iPad version of the game:</p>

        <p><em>iPad:</em> file sharing for the iPad version is primarily done
        via iTunes; any files you save will be available under Apps -> File
        Sharing when the iPad is connected to iTunes.  From there, you can
        export scenarios to disk and share them however you'd like (i.e., via
        email, via our forums, or whatever).  Additionally, any scenario files
        you add there will show up as user scenarios inside of the game.</p>

        <p>The application also registers the .tscx suffix and application/tscx
        MIME types with iOS; this allows users to load files from email or to
        download files directly from web sites that support that (admittedly
        rather non-standard) MIME type (such as our forums).  Whenever those
        files are opened in email (by holding down the file name and selecting
        TSC) or in Safari (and 'Open in TSC' is selected), the files will be
        loaded directly into the game.  Unfortunately, as Safari doesn't allow
        uploading files (as well as for other reasons), it's more difficult to
        go the other direction, and so exporting scenarios requires using iTunes
        as above.  Note that importing files in this fashion will cause an
        'Inbox' directory to be created in the App's document directory.  Once
        it exists, there's no known way to delete it (this seems to be a bug in
        iOS, neither the App nor iTunes seems to have permissions necessary to
        remove it).  However, it shouldn't cause any issues (well, you'll never
        be able to import a scenario named 'Inbox,' but I'm not sure why you'd
        ever want to name your scenario that).</p>

        <p><em>Mac:</em> to share (and load) scenarios, you can use the 'Export'
        and 'Import' buttons.  These will give you a standard OSX file dialog
        allowing you to load and save scenario files into (or from) the location
        of your choosing, from which you can then share them however you like
        (i.e., via email, via our forums, or whatever).</p>
<h3><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="6.2">6.2</span> Design Considerations</a></h3>
<p>It should probably go without saying, but the most important thing to
      do when building a scenario is to test it.  It's often hard to predict how
      the AI will behave in advance (or, if the default random parameters are
      used for the AI, at all), but even slight differences in planet/asteroid
      positions can make large differences in how the AI approaches things.
      It's also fairly easy to put the computer in positions it can't easily
      deal with, because, when you get right down to it, the AI is designed more
      to be very, very fast than to be particularly smart.  Since version 1.0, a
      fair amount of effort has been put into weeding out the more pathological
      parts of the AI that could be easily exploited, but that's only made it
      better, not perfect (and in less typical situations, it may have actually
      hurt it at times).</p>

      <p>Probably the most important thing to do to make it easy for the AI is
      to give it enough ships to match the type of strategies you expect it to
      use (i.e., if you don't give it many ships, don't ask it to build huge
      garrisons).  The AI plays much better when it has a lot of ships than when
      it only has a few, and it tends to deal with complexity reasonably well
      (although some geometries can trip it up badly).  It does less well on the
      "simple" scenarios because it can be more easily outmaneuvered &mdash;
      it's not doing much deep thinking, it's mostly just reacting.</p>

      <p>Something else to take into account is that different scenario
      difficulties are mostly achieved by changing production efficiencies
      (i.e., the computer produces more ships at the Impossible difficulty level
      than it does at Easy).  At higher difficulties, the computer will also get
      better commanders, but overall the effect this has on difficulty is
      comparatively limited.  So if the computer doesn't have much (or anything)
      in the way of production facilities, extra effort may be required to
      balance the scenario for the average player.</p>

      <p>One thing in particular to note is that the computer takes no notice of
      which of its ships will trigger a loss if they are lost (i.e., it treats
      all of its ships the same, no matter if they're tagged as victory
      conditions or not).  For this and other reasons (i.e., how easy it is to
      game), using ships as victory conditions is probably best used only in
      certain circumstances &mdash; i.e., when the player is otherwise forced to
      use the ships because that's all they have, or a timer forces them to
      carefully consider whether to commit them.  Or, perhaps, on the computer
      side, when their entire fleet is so designated and the player targets are
      fairly limited.  It's there as an option to try out, but to use it well
      probably will require some careful scenario design; the default victory
      conditions are far easier to work with.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, the AI plays the game pretty much the way the player does;
      it decides what planets build (influenced by the AI parameters), what
      targets to attack and what targets to bypass (again, influenced by the AI
      parameters), and how to organize its task forces once it's selected the
      targets to attack (or not); the computer has access to the same ships the
      player does, the same formations and options, and once those are set, the
      captains carry out their orders the same way they would if the human
      player had set it all up.  Fundamentally, it's playing the same game as a
      human player (albeit not as well as a talented human player would &mdash;
      although certainly better than a new player could before they get the hang
      of the game &mdash; hence the difficulty levels to keep things
      challenging).</a>
<h2><a href="#toc-anchor"><span id="7">7</span> Design Notes</a></h2>
<p>It might be obvious to the player that the game probably draws more
    inspiration from something like Harpoon than 4X space games.  Of course,
    that was always the idea; it's meant to be a streamlined sort of experience
    where the player focuses on the disposition of their fleet and their
    missions rather than on things like exploration, tech trees, diplomacy, or
    even resource exploitation.  The fact that you can't design your ships (or
    even upgrade them with newer tech) was done entirely on purpose to keep that
    focus on the command aspects of the game and the scenarios themselves.  The
    interface was also kept spare and simple on purpose to further emphasize
    that abstract nature, as well as to directly evoke the sort of utilitarian
    aesthetic that modern command and control systems have tended to have (such
    as you might see in the US Navy's Aegis Combat System's Command Information
    Center).</p>

    <p>(In addition, the interface was also always meant from the beginning to
    be touch-friendly &mdash; while the game was also released on OSX, and does
    take advantage of the slightly easier to use keyboad-and-mouse controls
    there, ultimately the iPad was always the primary design target.  The
    primary reason the Mac version exists is because it was easy; supporting
    both iOS and OSX APIs in Cocoa isn't so very difficult, the differences are
    mostly fairly minor.)</p>

    <p>I do like to think it makes the game a bit unique, and Harpoon isn't the
    only place it draws inspiration from.  The idea of commerce raiding is a
    core part of the game and something that draws inspiration from a number of
    sources (not least of which is Norm Koger's Stellar Crusade, which despite
    being a hard game to get into &mdash; I think it suffered a bit from the
    primitive interfaces of the time &mdash; did have some pretty interesting
    concepts in it.  I don't know how many people remember it, though).</p>

    <p>Anyway, I hope players enjoy the game.</p>

    <p>&mdash; Doug</p>
