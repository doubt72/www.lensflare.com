  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <p>Lensflare Games LLC<sup style="font-size: 10;">1</sup> is a
  Denver, Colorado-based software startup formed in 2013.  Our
  mission: to make the most awesomest strategy games we can make
  and have fun doing it.  Because what's the point of games that
  aren't fun?  And yes, "awesomest" totally is too a word.</p>

  <h1>Who We Are</h1>

  <p>We are <em>Douglas Triggs</em> and <em>Ai Ling Chow</em>.</p>

  <p><em>Douglas</em> is chief code monkey and bit wrangler.  He
  founded Lensflare Games LLC<sup style="font-size: 10;">1</sup>
  to create strategy games he wanted to play.  He's a strong
  believer that there's no such thing as too many great games, so
  why not take a shot at trying to make some?</p>

  <p><em>Ai Ling</em> is chief financial bit wrangler and handles
  the business of business.  She's also the note wrangler, er,
  handles the music. She helped found the company mainly on
  account of being married to Douglas.  Not that she doesn't like
  her share of games as well.</p>
