This is the Loki source for lensflare.com

This is all copyrighted, so you don't have permission to copy any of this stuff
or whatever [insert big shrug here], but nothing in here is exactly a state
secret (it's not like you couldn't just scrape the site for the generated HTML
anyway); I'm just replicating the repo here for convenience.
