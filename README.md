This is the Loki source for lensflare.com

This is all copyrighted, so you don't have permission to copy any of this stuff
or whatever, but why would you want to?  [Insert big shrug here.]  It's not like
anything here is exactly a state secret (i.e., it's not like you couldn't just
scrape the site for the generated HTML anyway).  I'm just replicating the repo
here for convenience; as long as it's here, feel free to use this as an extended
usage example for Loki if you like.
