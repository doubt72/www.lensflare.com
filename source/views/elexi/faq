  <h1>Supported Platforms</h1>

  <p><em>What platforms will be supported?</em></p>

  <p>Mobile devices &mdash; at minimum, iOS and Android.</p>

  <p><em>What operating system versions will be supported?</em></p>

  <p>iPads and iPhones that can run iOS 7 or later (i.e., the iPad 2 or later
  &mdash; including all versions of the iPad Mini &mdash; the iPhone 4 or later,
  and iPod Touch 5th Generation).  Android and other device requirements are
  still to be determined, but shouldn't be any trouble running on any
  equivalently powered devices.</p>

  <p><em>Will I be able to play the iPad version on my iPhone and
  vice-versa?</em></p>

  <p>The iOS version of Elexi will be universal, so
  will be able to be played on either type of device with one purchase.</p>

  <p><em>Will Elexi be available on any other
  platforms?</em></p>

  <p>Other than mobile?  No, there are no plans for any other platforms at this
  time.</p>
