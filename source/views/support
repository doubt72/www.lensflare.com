  <h1>Support</h1>

  <p>Here at Lensflare, we believe that games are never really
  finished, only released (once they're ready!)  Though we're an indie
  games studio and our resources are relatively limited, we're always
  striving to improve our games, be it with new features or other
  improvements.  We'd love to be perfect (we know we're not), but we
  are committed to releasing the highest quality games that we
  can.</p>

  <p>So, if you ever have an issue with one of our games, or ever want
  to contact us privately about any of them for any reason, please
  feel free to send us a note at
  { link_abs("mailto:support@lensflare.com", "support@lensflare.com") }.
  We're happy to hear from you, no matter if you've found a bug (we'd
  really like to fix those!), want to tell us what you think of our
  games (good or bad), or just have questions.</p>

  <p>You can also reach us at
  { link_abs("https://twitter.com/lensflare_games", "@lensflare_games") }
  on twitter.  Alternately, visit our page on
  { link_abs("http://www.facebook.com/lensflaregames", "Facebook") }.
