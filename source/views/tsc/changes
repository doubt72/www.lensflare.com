  <h1>Previous Versions</h1>

  <p>This is a list of the new features/bug fixes from previous
  versions of Tactical Space Command.</p>

  <h1>v1.2.2</h1>

  <ul>

    <li>Fix for problem with dialog; occasionally confirmation is
    ignored twice on startup.</li>

    <li>Fix for related issue with text dialogs; occasionally text
    won't display first two times on startup.</li>

    <li>Fix for duplicate planet names; user scenarios that use
    randomized planet names will sometimes produce duplicate names
    (more likely as planet count goes up). This will corrupt save
    files from games running those scenarios when that happens.</li>

    <li>Added feature to display which scenarios have been
    completed/won.</li>

  </ul>

  <h1>v1.2.1</h1>

    <li>Minor improvements to help and tips, as well as some typo
    fixes.</li>

  </ul>

  <h1>v1.0.6</h1>

  <ul>

    <li><em>[iPad only]</em> Added option to use triple-tap to zoom
    out instead of recenter (in which case quadruple-tap
    recenters)</li>

    <li><em>[iPad only]</em> Add support for two-finger double-tap for
    zooming out, three-finger double-tap for recenter (it doesn't
    really work as well as hoped, though).</li>

    <li><em>[Mac only]</em> ability to add waypoints with
    shift-right-click.</li>

    <li>Numerous minor layout/text/interface tweaks, updated tips,
    etc.</li>

    <li>Improved tutorial and help based on additional feedback from
    new users.</li>

    industry is damaged during invasions), minor balance tweaks,
    etc.</li>

    <li>Added a gamma control.</li>

    <li>Added a screen with all the help text/tips in one place for
    easy access for those who want to see them.</li>

    show prefix codes with names globally</li>

    <li>Added option to display classes on tactical map instead of
    names.</li>

    <li>Fixed scenario selection screen to be more responsive (i.e.,
    show that it's generating the new scenario instead of just hanging
    there like it does now).</li>

  </ul>

  <h1>v1.0.5</h1>

  <ul>

    <li><em>[iPad only]</em> fixed sound so that you can listen to
    your podcasts while playing if your sound is off (that one was for
    ourselves).</li>

    <li><em>[iPad only]</em> slight layout changes for officer/ship
    screens to make better use of space.</li>

    <li><em>[Mac only]</em> docked ships no longer have order menu
    displayed (since they couldn't be given orders while docked).</li>

    <li>Redesigned tactical screen multi-selection dialog to use
    columns instead of going off screen (mostly useful in iPad version
    due to imprecision of touch selection).</li>

    <li>Added ability to expand and collapse events on tactical
    screen.</li>

    <li>Various minor fixes for changes in iOS 7 text rendering, icons
    at the new iOS 7 icon sizes, etc., as well as some very minor
    tweaks and fixes.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>There are also fixes for the following bugs:</p>
  <ul>

    giving orders causes ships to move to the top left of the
    screen.</li>

    <li><em> [Mac only]</em> ctrl-left-click not interpreted as right
    click, unable to give orders.</li>

  </ul>
