<p>So one of the stories of the development of the word game so far is how the
design has changed.  The look, but especially the gameplay: it's hard to really
describe how different it is &mdash; It's gone from a gadget to something with
a fair amount of strategic depth (which, despite the kind of games I've done
before, still surprised me.  That's really not where I expected it to go at
all).</p>

<div class="blog-image-right">

       image('blog/t/word-screen.png',
             {alt: 'Setup Screen', class: 'ss-link',
              style: 'width: 180; height: 320;'}})) }
  <div class="blog-image-subtitle">
    progress
  </div>
</div>

<p>Things that haven't changed? Well, it's still untimed (which was a
non-negotiable design choice from the very beginning).  It still involves
spelling words.  It <i>might</i> still be multilingual, although the jury is
still out there.  So far I've only configured it for English and a minimal
"test" language (although even with English the word list needs some tweaking).
The code itself supports arbitrary languages, though, both for the interface and
for gameplay.</p>

<p>So why did it change so much?  Mainly because of the process of playing
(read: testing) the prototypes during development. it's still basically an alpha
(which means that I'm pretty much the only person playing it), though hopefully
it'll go to beta fairly soon (i.e., more people will be playing it).  Which is
to say I've made quite a bit of progress on it and have reached the point where
the gameplay has settled down enough that I've been able to spend the last week
or so[<a href="#foot-1" id="back-1">1</a>] almost exclusively tightening up and
balancing the game (as well as spending quite a bit of time working on the
visual aspects), instead of figuring out how to fix mechanics that were still
pretty clearly broken or uninteresting.</p>

<p>Anyway, it still needs a name.  Most of the other things that need to be done
can wait until after the beta opens, but the name I want ready before I start
putting it out there.  And with a name will come icon art and a web page and
screen shots and such.</p>

<p class="blog-footnote">[<a href="#back-1" id="foot-1">1</a>] this is really
the first work I've done on it since the first half of the month when I was
still in Germany &mdash; not only did we spend about a week visiting family or
sightseeing in Europe, when we got back we discovered that the AC was out.
During a major heat wave.  So, uh, took about a week to get that fixed, and in
the meantime was either crashing at a friend's place or generally broiling.
Either way, didn't have much energy until that was dealt with.</p>
