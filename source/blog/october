<p>It's been a while, hasn't it?  So...  Well, some updates.</p>

<h2>Elexi</h2>

<p>So, first off...  Elexi is releasing. <i>Finally.</i></p>

<div class="blog-image-right">
{ link('blog/elexi-promo-1024.png',
       image('elexi-promo-400.png',
             {alt: 'elexi promo', class: 'ss-link',
              style: 'width: 300; height: 146;'}})) }
  <div class="blog-image-subtitle">
    Elexi promo!
  </div>
</div>

<p>It took longer than expected because, well, localization isn't exactly
trivial, and there were also distractions in the form of visitors, family, and
related travel.  All of the latter pushed things back almost two months later
than it could have been (localization wasn't ready until just after that all
started, so maybe &mdash; but maybe not &mdash; things could have been finalized
then if that had been just a tad quicker).  Regarding localization specifically,
that took a bit of time just to coordinate and finish, but mostly it meant lots
(and lots) of pretty tedious testing of everything to make sure everything fit
correctly, nothing is cut off or overflows, and oh, the 200(!) individually
created screenshots for the app stores to cover the major form factors in every
localized language. Plus a bunch of other promo assets that had to be
localized.</p>

<p>...At any rate, let's just say, localization is a lot of work, on the order
of weeks.  I thought it'd be quicker, to be completely honest, and I thought
Elexi would be ready about a month ago.  Making it international probably
doubled (conservatively!) the amount of time spent on Elexi (if you include the
time spent on word lists), but...  Well, hopefully it was worth it?  We'll
see.</p>

<p>Anyway, go { link("elexi", "check it out") }.  And buy it, it's only
$0.99.</p>

<h2>So, How's That Unity Thing Going, Anyway?</h2>

<p>Given that I mainly did it for a "quick" test of Unity (hahaha, ouch, I'm
hurting myself here, oh God, no, those aren't tears, why, God, why)...  Well.
It did that.</p>

<div class="blog-image-left">
{ link('elexi/screenshot5.png',
       image('elexi/screenshot5.png',
             {alt: 'elexi japanese', class: 'ss-link',
              style: 'width: 180; height: 320;'}})) }
  <div class="blog-image-subtitle">
    Screenshot!
  </div>
</div>

<p>Unity is kind of a pile of crap &mdash; I suppose actually having the pro
version would likely mitigate some of the pain, mainly by having tech support,
but damn, there are some amazingly annoying bugs that I had to work around that
had shit-all to do with any code I wrote &mdash; but I'm probably going to keep
using it.  Why?  Well...  I kind of know it now, it's widely enough used that
getting around the broken stuff is (mostly) a concerted google away, but more
importantly, where would I go?  Everything else either has worse licensing or is
missing key cross-platform support or is otherwise just not mature enough or has
any of a number of other drawbacks.  So.  Unity is it for now, I guess.</p>

<p>To be completely honest...  Most professional software is pretty much like
this (by which I mean, the kind of stuff I've worked on or with my entire
career).  Bugs are common, hair-pulling is the norm, yadda, yadda.  Profound
mediocrity is just the way things are with complex software packages when you
don't have infinite time to polish, test, and debug. Even polished commercial
software has bugs (as pretty much everyone knows first hand).  Unity is pretty
bad and often frustrating to work with...  But not the worst I've seen?  So I
curse it but I also shrug. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ &#x1f4a9;</p>

<h2>That Twitter Thing</h2>

<p>So, I'm essentially putting the "official" Lensflare Games twitter account

({ link_abs("https://www.twitter.com/lensflare_games", "@lensflare_games")})

on hiatus, because I've decided that I don't really want to deal with
maintaining two twitter accounts.  I mean, it's not a lot of work, but I also
don't see a strong case for doing it, so...  For the time being I'm just going
to use my personal twitter

({ link_abs("https://www.twitter.com/doubt72", "@doubt72")})

for everything, and post game updates there instead.  Not that I post a whole
lot of those, anyway.  So enjoy the cat pictures that inevitably get mixed in.
Or not.  Apologies to my 50-odd Lensflare Games followers, especially the dozen
or so that are actual real people.</p>

<h2>And So...?</h2>

<p>TSC2 is the new thing.  That's the thing.  The thing I'm doing now.<p>
