<p>So the election was a thing that happened.</p>

<p>And that means...  Election Manager 2016 got updated.  I actually pushed the
update early his morning[<a href="#foot-1" id="back-1">1</a>] and Apple was
particularly quick on the approvals, so it's already out there.  Last I checked,
it didn't show the 1.2.0 version on the iOS App Store (it already did on the Mac
App Store), but it will almost certainly be there by the time I finish writing
this or especially by the time anyone reads this, and people should be getting
version 1.2.0 soon.</p>

<p>The balance isn't quite perfect for the 2016 scenario[<a href="#foot-2"
id="back-2">2</a>], the popular vote skews a bit republican to make the
electoral college accurate, so it's now slightly more likely to result in a
democrat electoral vote win with a republican popular vote win than the
reverse&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;the opposite of what actually happened).  But the EV
totals are more important (since that's actually what determines who actually
wins, after all). I'm planning to approach things a little differently (and
increase the ability to accurate calibrate things) whenever I write EM20; I
never expected things to shift so radically from last election to this when I
was writing EM16 two years ago (considering how stable things had been for the
previous several elections). But there were a <i>lot</i> of things that were
different about this election that were impossible to capture with the existing
model.[<a href="#foot-3" id="back-3">3</a>]</em>

<p>Anyway, the upgrade is up now, or go grab the latest for iOS on the

{ link_abs("https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/election-manager-2016/id923812702",
           "App Store") } or for Mac on the

{ link_abs("https://itunes.apple.com/app/election-manager-2016/id923812695",
           "Mac App Store") }.

<p class="blog-footnote">[<a href="#back-1" id="foot-1">1</a>]  well, yesterday
morning now, i.e., once the returns had reached the point that I could make
proper recalibration of the changes in partisan balance, plus some
time to make updated screenshots.</p>

<p class="blog-footnote">[<a href="#back-2" id="foot-2">2</a>] the 2016 scenario
is now "special" in that it's not balanced quite the same way as the 2012 or
generic scenarios.  I justify this mainly because the candidates were not at all
typical of historical norms, but also because really changing the balance is
hard to do with the current engine without making major changes and potentially
breaking things and requiring a whole lot of testing.  So, it's a bit of a
band-aid.  I do plan to make this sort of thing easier to do if and when I write
EM20 in which case I'd build a new engine for it (which would additionally have
other properties that would improve the game as a game).<p>

<p class="blog-footnote">[<a href="#back-3" id="foot-3">3</a>] Trump broke my
game, too.<p>
