<p>So...  Been in Köln about a week now, mostly working on the word game.  Will
be staying here about another week, although the last couple days the wife will
be here and I'll be switching to tourist mode with her (and a few days after
that will all be Netherlands and Belgium, so will be more of the same in new
places, plus the wedding part).  But for now, the trip's been every bit as
productive as I'd hoped: I've pretty much completed a first pass at the word
game, even gotten far enough along to do some initial playtesting, which
resulted in a rewrite of some of the core mechanics. A few cosmetic things are
left to be done, as well as data persistence (for saving the current game when
paused or closed, as well as high scores), getting the internationalization
tested (don't have any data except for English yet, don't know if I'll find any
or not, but I <i>want</i> it), and a tutorial.</p>

<p>But...  It's functional, complete with unit tests and such.  I've even been
able to spend a fair bit of time refactoring the code to make it more
maintainable/easier to make changes down the road.</p>

<p>So...  Unity?  I've gotten used to it, I guess.  It helps that all the work
I've done the last few days is in the code (i.e., all C#), so I haven't had to
deal with the Unity editor thing beyond running things.  I mean, the APIs for
doing things are...  Weird and unintuitive and clunky (it makes me nostalgic for
Cocoa and Objective-C, and that's considering that XCode and I haven't ever been
the best of friends), but I've figured out what I need to figure out, and since
the incantations have been made, I can encapsulate/cargo cult the shit out of
that and ignore it from now on.  I suppose a significant part of my dislike of
Unity is a dislike of MonoDevelop (or at least, the Unity version, I don't know
how close to the main branch it is).  Fortunately, the terrible memory leaks are
pretty much managed by the constant crashes, so it's fine!  But I'm planning to
try working with Unity with a different editor sometime soon, and at that point,
maybe Unity approaches reasonably tolerable.  Or at least, I'm getting
accommodated to it.</p>

<p>I suppose at this point, the biggest thing that makes me uncomfortable about
Unity is the license model.  I don't like licensing software, especially
anything this key to my workflow, I'd rather just buy it outright, because if
all I have is a license, there's nothing that keeps the license from changing
out from under you, and, well.  It's similar to my discomfort dealing with app
stores and the like, too, it's pretty easy to change stuff and just screw
developers.  But it's a necessary evil, and you deal.</p>

<p>So.  I might still try something else like Godot or Cocos2D (i.e., something
open source &mdash; my needs aren't extreme, it just has to have the right
feature set for me).  But I guess we'll see, I'm not sure if that window has
passed or not.</p>
